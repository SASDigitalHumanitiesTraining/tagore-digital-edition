## CM.13, [THE LAND OF THE EXILE]

Mother, the light has grown grey in the sky, I do not know what the time is ~~now~~.
~~But my heart is not~~^There is no fun^ in my play and I have come to you. It is Saturday, our holiday.
Leave off your work motherm sit here by the window and tell me where ~~is~~ the heath of TepƒÅntar ~~off~~^in^ the fairy tale ^is^?

The shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end.
The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails.
When the clouds rumble and it thunders, I love to be afraid in my heart and cling to you.
When the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind I like to sit alone in the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about the heath of Tepantar ~~of~~^in^ the fairy tale.

Where is ~~this heath~~^it^, mother, ~~at~~^on^ the shore of what sea, at the foot of what hills, ~~at~~^in^ the kingdom of what king ~~of what country~~?

There are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath across it by which the villagers reach their village in the evening and the woman who gathers dry stics in the forest can bring her load to the market. With ~~the~~ patches of yellow grass in the sand~~s~~ and ~~with~~ only ~~the~~ one tree where the pair of the wise old birds have their nest, lies the trackless heath of Tepantar ~~of the fairy tale.
