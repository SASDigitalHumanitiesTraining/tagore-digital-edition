[F 38]

21.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a child that frets and pushes away its toys, \
my heart to-day shakes its head ^at every phrase I suggest^ ~~at all my utterings~~ and \
says, "No, not this". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The~~ words, in the agony of their vagueness, haunt \
my mind, like vagrant clouds hovering over hills waiting \
for some chance wind~~s~~ to unburthen ^relieve^ them of their rain. [?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But leave ~~your~~ ^these^ vain efforts, my soul, for the still-\
ness will ripen its own music in the dark. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life to-day is like a cloister ~~where~~ ^during^ some penance \
~~goes on~~, ~~and~~ ^where^ the spring is afraid to ~~walk there~~ ^stir^ or to whisper. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no~~t~~ ~~the~~ time, my love, ~~when~~ ^for^ you ~~must come to~~ ^to pass the^ \
~~my~~ gate; ~~for nothing but~~ ^at the mere thought of^ your ~~own~~ anklet bells ~~sing in my~~ ^tinkling down^ \
~~garden~~ ^the^ path, ~~making its~~ ^the garden^ echoes ^are^ ashamed. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that to-morrow's songs are in bud to-day, and \
~~when~~ ^should^ they see you walk by ~~them~~ they ^would^ struggle to burst their \
^immature^ hearts ~~in an untimely surrender~~. 

[All crossed out + in pencil] \
My life today is like a cloister ~~which~~ ^during^ some penance \
~~is in progress~~, where the spring is afraid to  ...? \
This is no time, my love for you to pass the gate, at the mere \
thought of your anklet bell tinkling down the path, \
the garden ~~path's~~ echoes are ashamed. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that tomorrow's songs are in bud today and \
Should they see you walk by they would struggle to burst their \
immature hearts.
