&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Not that bitterness!~~ ^Not so much bitterness!^ ~~s~~^S^mile^,^ ^and^ give me leave to ~~depart~~ ^go^. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile! But, my friend, ~~your Paradise is not here~~ ^This is not your native Paradise^, ~~and a~~ \
smile^s^ ~~is~~ not ^so^ cheap in this world^,^ where thirst like a worm in \
the flower, gnaws at the ^heart^'s^^ core ~~of our~~ ^;^ - where baffled \
desire hovers round the desired, and ~~foolish~~ memory ~~will not~~ ^never ceases^ \
~~cease~~ to sigh ^foolishly^ after vanished joy. 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devayani, tell me ~~what has been my offence~~ ^how I have offended^.

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it so easy for you to leave this forest, which ~~for~~ ^through^ long \
years has lavished on you ~~all its hush and hum, and~~ shade and \
song~~s~~? Do you not feel how the wind ~~is~~ wail~~ing~~^s^ ~~today~~ through \ ~~its~~ ^these^ shimmering shadows and dry leaves whirl~~ing~~ in the air, like \
~~some~~ ghost^s^ of lost hope, - while ~~it is only~~ you ^alone^^,^ who ~~are to~~ part \
from us ~~with~~ ^have^ a smile on your lips?
