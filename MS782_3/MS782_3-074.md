&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a child that frets and pushes away its toys^,^ my \
heart to-day shakes its head at every phrase I suggest^,^ and [9/] \
says, "No, not this". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet words, in the agony of their vagueness, haunt my \
mind, like vagrant clouds hovering over hills^,^ waiting for some \
chance wind to relieve them of their rain. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But leave these vain efforts, my soul, for the stillness \
will ripen its own music in the dark. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life to-day is like a cloister during some penance^,^ \
where the spring is afraid to stir or to whisper. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the
time, my love, for you to pass the gate; \
at the mere thought of your anklet bells tinkling down the \
path, the garden echoes are ashamed. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that to-morrow's songs are in bud to-day, and should \
they see you walk by they would ~~struggle~~ ^strain^ to ~~burst~~ ^breaking^ their [10/] \
immature hearts.
