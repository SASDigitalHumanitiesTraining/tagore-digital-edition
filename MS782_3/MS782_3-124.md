&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds thicken till the morning light seems like a \
bedraggled fringe to the rainy night. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little girl stands at her window, still as a rainbow \
at the gate of a broken^-^down storm. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is my neighbour, and has come upon the earth like \
some god's rebellious laughter. Her mother in anger calls \
her incorrigible; her father smiles and calls her mad. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like a runaway waterfall leaping over boulders, \
like the topmost bamboo twig rustling in the restless wind. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stands at her window looking out into the sky. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sister comes to say, "Mother calls you". She shakes \
her head. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her little brother with his toy boat comes and tries to \
pull her off to play^:^ she snatches her hand~~s away~~. ^from his^ The boy \
persists and she gives him a slap on the back. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first great voice was the voice of the wind and water \
in the beginning of earth's creation. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ancient cry of nature - her dumb call to unborn life - \
has reached this child's heart and leads it out alone beyond \
the fence of our times^:^ so ~~?~~ there she  stands^,^ possessed by \
eternity^!^
