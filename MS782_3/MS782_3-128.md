&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, my little daughter heard a call from her \
companions below the window. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She timidly went down the dark stairs holding a lamp in \
her hand, ~~guard~~ ^shield^ing it behind her veil. \
[pencil note: a break here] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting on my terrace ~~,~~ in the star-lit night of \
March, when at a sudden cry I ran to see ~~!~~ ^.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lamp had gone out in the dark ~~,~~ spiral staircase. I \
asked, "Child, why did you cry?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From below she answered in distress, "Father, I have \
lost myself ~~"~~. ^"^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back to the terrace under the star-lit night \
of March, I looked at the sky^,^ and it seemed that a child was \
walking there ~~guarding~~ ^treasuring^ many lamps behind their veils. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their light went out, she would suddenly stop and a \
cry would sound from sky to sky, "Father, I have lost myself ~~"~~ ^!"^
