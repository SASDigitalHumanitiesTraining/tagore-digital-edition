&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that my heart will leave ~~for ever~~ its own \
colour in all your scenes, ~~my~~ ^O^ Earth, when I ~~take my~~ ^bid you^ farewell. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~In~~ ^Some notes of mine will be added^ to your seasons' melody ~~will be added some notes~~ \
~~which are mine~~, and my thoughts will breathe ~~unknown~~ ~~^without recognition^~~  ^unrecognised^ \
~~in man's~~ ~~world~~ through ^the^ ~~its~~ ~~^man's^~~ cycle of shadows and \
sunshine. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[taken from bottom] ^In two far distant days summer will come to \
the lovers' garden, but they^ \
^In far distant days^ summer will come ~~In far distant days~~ ~~in~~ ^to^ the ^lovers'^ garden \
~~of levers~~, but they will not know that their flowers ha~~s~~^ve^ \
borrowed ~~from me some snatches of~~ ^an added beauty from^ my songs ~~and~~ ^nor that^ their love \
for this world has ^been^ deepened ~~because I had loved it~~ ^by mine^ ~~^my love of it^~~.
