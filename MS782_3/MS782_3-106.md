Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own son, Duryodhana? 

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a terrible boon for you, his mother, to crave ^!^

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fathers of the Kauravas, who are in ~~p~~^P^aradise, join me \
in beseeching you. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divine judge
will punish him who has broken his laws. \
But I am his father.

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I not his mother? Have I not carried him under my \
throbbing heart? Yes^,^ I ask you to renounce Duryodhana the \
unrighteous. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will remain to us after that? 

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's blessing. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what will that bring us? 

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New afflictions. Pleasure in our son's presence, pride
