My mind still buzzed with the cares of a busy ~~?~~ day; \
I sat on without noting how twilight was deepening \
into dark. Suddenly light stirred across the gloom \
and touched me as with a finger. \
I lifted my head and met the gaze of the full moon \
widened in wonder like a child's. It held my eyes for long, \
and I felt as though a love-letter had been secretly drop- \
-ped in at my window. and ever since my heart is break \
-ing to write for answer something fragrant as night's \
unseen flowers - great as her declaration spelt out in \
nameless stars.
