~~10.~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I shall stop startled if ever we meet ~~in~~ ^after^ \
our next birth walking in the light of a far away world. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall know ~~that~~ those dark eyes ~~are the~~ ^then as^ morning \
stars, ~~which dance~~ ^and yet feel that they have^ belonged to ~~and evening of an~~ ^some^ unremembered ^evening^ \
sky ~~in my life~~ ^of a former life^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall know that the magic of your face is not all \
its own, but ~~from an immemorial meeting it~~ has stolen the \
passionate light that was once in my eyes ^at some immemorial meeting^, and ^then^ gathered \
from my love a mystery that has ^now^ forgotten its ~~source~~ ^origin^.
