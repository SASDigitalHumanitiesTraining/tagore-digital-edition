[F 107]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back to ~~my~~ ^the^ terrace, ~~in~~ ^under^ the star-lit night \
of March, I looked ~~in~~ ^at^ the sky and it seemed ~~to me~~ that a \
child ~~?~~ was walking ^there^ guarding ~~her~~ ^many^ lamps behind \
her veils. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ~~the~~ ^their^ light went out, she would suddenly stop and a \
cry would sound from sky to sky, "Father, I ~~miss~~ ^have lost^ ~~want~~ myself." 

16.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening stood bewildered among street lamps, its \
gold tarnished by the city's dust. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman, gaudily decked and painted, stood leaning \
over \
the rail~~s~~ of ~~her~~ ^a^ balcony, a living fire waiting for \
its moths. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly an eddy was formed in the road round a street \
boy crushed ~~by~~ ^under the wheels of a^ carriage ~~wheels~~ and the woman in the balcony \
fell down screaming on the floor in agony, stricken with \
the grief of the Great ^white-robed^ Mother, ~~white-robed~~ who sits in \
the world's inner shrine.
