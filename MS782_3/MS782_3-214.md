&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Still she did not speak~~ I was ~~about~~ to go away ^still she did not speak^ ~~when~~. But \
I felt, from a slight quiver, ~~the~~ ^her^ yearning ~~of her~~ arms ~~which~~ \
~~seemed to~~ ^would say: "Ah no, not yet". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often heard ~~her voice in the pleading of her~~ ^her pleading hands vocal^ \
~~hands~~, in a ~~?~~ touch, ~~unaware of its meaning~~ ^though they knew not what they said.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known those arms to ~~hesitate while holding up~~ ^stammer when, had they not^, \
^they would have become^ youth's garland ~~to put ?~~ ^round my^ neck. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Their little gestures ~~come to my~~ ^return^ to ~~my~~ remembrance ~~like~~ ~~as~~ \
truants ~~escape return~~ to play with her secrets with my secret store of in the shadow of still \
hours~~ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~^Their little gestures return to remembrance \
as truants escape to play. They are welcomed in \
secrecy by all those that ? I know ^her^ in the covert \
of ~~?~~ ^still^ hours.^~~ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^Their little gestures return to remembrance \
as truants escape to play. They are welcomed \
by all that I know ^of her, in the covert \
of still hours.^
