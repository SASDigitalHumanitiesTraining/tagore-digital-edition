# MS 782/3

[F 253]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid-servant of forty drudges through the day, quarrels \
with her mistress, threatens to, but never leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day some small repairs are done. paper is pasted \
in place of missing panes; gaps in the railings are made \
good with split bamboo; an empty box keeps the boltless gate \
shut; old stains vaguely show through new whitewash on the \
walls. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the magnificence of wealth had found a fitting memorial \
in gaunt desolation^:^ but, lacking sufficient means^,^ they try \
to hide this with dubious devices^,^ and its dignity is out- \
raged. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have overlooked the deserted room on the north side. \
And its forlorn door still bangs in the wind^,^ like Despair \
beating her breast.
