KUNTI \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art great, \
My son, the helpless babe, whom his false mother \
Abandoned, has ^through devious hazards helped \
and unwatched years, returned a giant foe^ \
To smite her sons: punished of God, am I! 

KARNA \
Mother, fear na~~i~~^u^ght; I know thy sons shall win \
Tomorrow's battle. The knowledge strains my soul; \
This heart beats to the tune of hope forlorn ^-^ \
Drums to a baffled close^!^ Ask me not, then, \
To leave my ~~brave~~ ^valiant^ Kauravas to their doom: \
Thou canst not offer terms which they can take, \
And I embrace no fortune they share not. \
Let thy Pandavas seize both throne and land, \
Their fate bestows them. I am marked to lose, \
Who was cast naked on unnamed disgrace \
That night when I was born; so leave, once more, \
Me to calm expectation of defeat \
And to a death I need not blush to front. 



(As she turns to go the scene closes).
