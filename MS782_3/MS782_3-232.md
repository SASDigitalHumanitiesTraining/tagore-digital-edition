&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that ~~they were not~~ ^your brief days of love have not been^ left behind ~~, - the brief~~ \
~~days of love~~ in ~~your life of~~ ^those^ scanty years ^of your life^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek to know ~~where~~ ^in what place^ ~~you keep them now,~~ away from \
the slow-thieving dust ^you keep them now^. ~~and~~ I find in my solitude some \
song of your evening that died, yet ~~fell the deathless~~ ^left a deathless echo^, and \
the sighs of ~~unsated~~ ^your unsatisfied^ hours ~~laid~~ ^I find^ nestled in the warm quiet \
of the autumn noon. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your desires come from the hive of the past to haunt \
my heart and I sit still to listen to their wings.
