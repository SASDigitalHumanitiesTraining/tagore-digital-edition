&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~My~~ ~~f~~^F^ortune has proved ~~my~~ ^a^ friend ^,^ and my doubts are \
dispelled. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds, sing your best, moon, shed your fairest light! \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let fly your darts, Love^-^God, in millions! \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait for the moment when my body will grow golden \
~~by~~ ^at^ his touch. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vidyapati says, "Immense is your good fortune^,^ and \
blessed is your love." 

3. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel my body vanishing into the dust where ^-on my beloved^ walks. \
~~my beloved.~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel ~~I am~~ one with the water ^of the lake^ where he bathes ~~in the~~ \
~~lake.~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Sakhi, my love crosses death's ~~limits~~ ^boundary^ when I \
meet him ^.^ ~~??~~
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart melts in the light and merges in the mirror \
~~in which~~ ^whereby^ he ~~sees~~ ^views^ his face. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move ~~?~~ with the ~~breeze~~ ^air^ to kiss him when he ~~moves~~ ^waves^ his \
fan, and wherever he wanders I ~~embrace~~ ^enclose^ him ~~as~~ ^like^ the sky. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Govindadas says, "You are the gold^-setting^, fair maiden, \
~~clasping him who~~ ^he^ is the emerald"

4. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love, I will keep you hidden in my eyes ~~:~~^;^ I will \
~~weave~~ ^thread^ your image like a gem ~~in~~ ^on^ my joy and ~~hold~~ ^hang^ it on my bosom.
