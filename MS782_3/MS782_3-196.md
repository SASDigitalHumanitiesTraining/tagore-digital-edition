30. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain fell fast. The river rushed and hissed. \
It licked ^up^ and swallowed the ^is^land while I waited alone on \
the lessening bank with my sheaves of corn in a heap. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shadows of the opposite shore ~~sails a~~ ^the boat^ cross^es^ \
~~the boat~~ with ~~the~~ ^a^ woman at the helm. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cry to her, "Come to my island coiled ~~a~~round with \
hungry water, and take away my year's harvest." 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes^,^ ~~and~~ and takes all that I have to the last \
grain; ~~and~~ I ask her ~~also~~ to take me. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she says, "No" - ~~for~~ the boat ~~can be~~ ^is^ laden \
~~only~~ with my gift ~~and room there is none for me.~~ ^and no room is left for me.^
