~~27.~~ ^11^  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither mother nor daughter are you, nor bride, Urvashi*. \
Woman you are, ~~who~~ ^to^ ravish the soul of paradise. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ^weary-footed^ evening ~~with weary steps descends upon~~ ^comes down to^ the folds \
~~where~~ ^whither^ the cattle have returned, you never trim the house \
lamps ~~fox the night~~, nor ~~do you~~ walk to the bridal bed with \
a tremulous heart and a wavering smile on your lips ~~in the~~ ^glad that^ \
~~secret of~~ the dark hours.^are so secret.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the dawn you are without veil, Urvashi, and \
without shame. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Who knows, when you came to yourself out of an aching~~ ^Who can imagine that aching overflow of splendour which^ \
~~overflow of splendour.~~  ^created you!^ 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The dancing girl of Paradise who rose from the sea. 

^------------^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You rose from the churned ocean on the first day of \
the first spring with ~~a~~ ^the^ cup of life in your right hand and \
poison in your left. The monster sea, ^lulled^ like an enchanted \
snake, laid ^down^ its thousand hoods at your feet. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~?~~ ^Your un-blemished radiance^ rose from the foam white and naked as a jasmine, \
~~you of unblemished radiance.~~ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Did~~ ^Were^ you ever ~~have to begin you being in the first \
hesitation of a bud,~~ Urvashi^,^ ~~of~~ ^O^ ~~y~~^Y^outh everlasting? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you sleep cradled in the ~~bottom of the~~ ^deep^ blue night \
~~lit by~~ ^where^ ~~gems of~~ ^the^ strange ~~shapes and~~ light ^of gems^ ~~?~~ plays ~~with~~ ^over^ \
coral~~s~~ ~~and~~^,^ shells and ~~?~~ moving creatures of dreamlike \
form~~s~~^,^ till ~~you appeared in the light~~ ^day revealed^in an awful fullness \
of bloom? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Ever~~ ~~a~~^A^dored are you of all men in all ages, Urvashi^,^ \
~~of~~^O^ endless wonder. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world quakes ^throbs^ with ~~the~~ ^youthful^ pain ~~of ?~~ at the glance \
of your eyes, the ascetic lays ~~his~~^this^ fruit~~s~~ of ^his^ austerities at \
your feet, ~~and~~ ^the songs of ^ poets ~~' songs~~ hum and swarm round the perfume \
of your presence. Your feet, as ~~they flit on~~ in careless \
joy, ^they flit on^ ~~wound the wind at every step~~ ^even wound the heart of the hollow wind^ with the tinkle of golden \
bells.
