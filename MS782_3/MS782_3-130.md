&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the scene on the barren heath - ~~the~~ ^a^ girl ~~sitting~~ ^sat^ \
alone on the grass before the gispy ~~-~~ camp^,^ braiding her hair in \
the afternoon shade. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her little dog jumped and barked at her busy hands, as \
though her employment had no importance. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain did she rebuke it, calling it "a pest", saying \
she was tired of its perpetual silliness. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struck it on the nose with her reproving fore-finger^,^ \
which only seemed to delight it the more. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked menacingly grave for a few moments^,^ to warn it \
of impending doom ~~,~~^;^ and then, letting her hair fall, quickly \
snatched it up in her arms, laughed and pressed it to her \
heart.
