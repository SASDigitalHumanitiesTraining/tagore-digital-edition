^In the night the song came to me; but you were not \
there. \
It found the words for which I had been seeking all \
day. Yes, in the stillness, a moment after dark they \
throbbed into music, ~~like~~ ^even as^ the stars then commenced \
~~throbb~~ pulsing with light; but you were not there. \
My hope was to sing it to you in the morning but \
try as I might, though the music came, the words \
hung back, when you were beside me.^
