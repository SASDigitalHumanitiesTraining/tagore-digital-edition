&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The d~~ ^D^ays were ~~lengthening~~ ~~with the end of~~ ^as the^ winter ~~months~~ ^ended^, \
and, ^in the sun^, my dog played ~~in the sun with the pet deer~~ in his ~~own~~ wild ~~manner~~ ^way^ ^with the pet deer^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^thus: Days were drawing as the winter ended \
and, in the sun, my dog played in his wild way with \
the pet deer.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd~~s~~ going to the market gathered by the fence, \
and laughed to see the love of these playmates struggl~~ing~~^e^ \
~~in~~ ^with^ languages ^so^ dissimilar. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring was in the air, and the young leaves \
fluttered like flames. ~~in~~ ^A gleam danced in^ the deer's dark eyes ~~dancing~~ \
~~?~~ when she started^,^ ~~and~~ bent her neck at the movement \
of her own shadow, or raised her ears to listen to some \
whisper in the wind. 

[moved from the bottom] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message comes floating with the errant ~~wind~~ ^breeze^, with \
the rustle and glimmer abroad in the April sky. It sings of \
the first ache of youth in the world, when the first flower \
broke out from its bud, and love went forth seeking that \
which it knew not, leaving ~~its would of the?~~ ^all it had^ known. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~O~~^And o^ne afternoon, when among the amlak [underlined] trees the shadow \
grew grave and sweet with the ~~?~~ ^furtive^ caress of light, the \
deer ~~began~~ ^set off^ to run like a meteor ~~that was~~ in love with death. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It grew dark, and lamps were lighted in the house; \
the stars came out and night was upon the fields, but the \
deer never came back. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dog ran up to me whining, questioning me with his \
piteous eyes which seemed to say, "I do not understand."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who does ever understand?
