&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laugh and make merry with friends ~~w~~^t^hen suddenly I \
start up ~~to see~~ ^for lo!^ ~~him~~ ^he^ pass^es me^ by in sorrow, and I know my mirth \
~~is vanity.~~ ^was vain^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~But~~ ^I have^ often ~~I have~~ seen a smile in his eyes when my \
heart ached ~~in pain and~~ ^then^ I knew my sorrow was not real. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I never complain ~~that~~ ^when^ I do not understand him. 

8.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the boat, ~~and~~ you are the sea, and also the boatman. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~If~~ ^Though^ you never ~~take me~~ ^make the^ ~~a~~shore, ~~if~~ ^though^ you let me sink, why \
should I be foolish and afraid? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ~~the~~ reaching ~~of~~ the shore a greater prize than \
losing myself ~~in~~ ^with^ you? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ~~be~~ ^are^ ^only^ the haven ~~only~~, as they say, then what is \
the sea? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it ~~break in~~ surge~~s~~ and toss me ~~in~~ ^on^ its waves, I \
shall be content. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in you whatever and however you ~~are~~ ^appear^. Save me \
or kill me as you wish, only ~~do not~~ ^never^ leave me in other ~~'s~~ hands. 

9. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make way, O bud, make way, burst open thy heart and \
make way. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~For~~ ~~t~~^T^he ^opening^ spirit ~~of flower~~ has overtaken thee, canst \
thou remain a bud any longer?
