[ital] [Emter RAMA (underlined). Ama's (underline) mother.]
Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother mine, I had not hoped to see you again. Let me \
take dust from your feet. 

Rama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch me not with impure hands^!^ 

Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as pure as yourelf. 

Rama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom have you surrendered your honour?

Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my husband. 

Rama. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Husband? A mussulman ~~,~~ the husband of a Brahmin woman? 

Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not merit contempt: I am proud to say I never des- \
pised my husband though a Mussulman. If ~~p~~^P^aradise will reward \
your devotion to your husband, then the same ~~p~~^P^aradise waits \
for your daughter^,^ who has been as true a wife.  

Rama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you indeed a true wife?

Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.
