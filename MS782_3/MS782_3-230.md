~~23.~~ ^20^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river is grey and the air dazed with blown sand~~s~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~In~~ ^On^ a morning of dark disquiet, when the birds are mute, ^and^ \
their nests shak~~ing~~^e^ in the gust, I sit alone and ask myself, \
"Where is she?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Days had passed, and while~~ ^The days have flown wherein^ ~~^have^~~ we sat too near each other \
we laughed and jested, and the awe of love's majesty found \
no words ~~in~~ ^at^ our meeting^s^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made myself small, and she trifled away every moment \
with ~~the~~ pelting ~~of~~ talk ~~that was trivial~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day I wish in vain that she were by me, in the gloom \
of the coming storm, to sit in the ~~solitude~~ of soul^'s solitude^.
