~~35.~~ ^8^  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am like the night to you, little flower. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only give you peace and ^a^ wakeful silence ~~from~~ ^hidden^ \
~~behind~~ ^in^ the dark. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the morning you open your eyes, I shall leave \
you to the world humming with its bees and singing with its \
birds. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last gift to you will be a tear ~~-~~ drop ^dropped into^ ~~in~~ the depth \
of your youth, ~~which~~ ^it^ will make your smile all the sweeter, \
and ~~its mist will screen you from the~~ ^be-mist your vision of the^ pitless mirth of ^day.^ \
~~the day~~
