33.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the water there is no landing; the \
girls do not come here to fetch water; the land along its \
edge is shaggy with stunted shrubs; a noisy flock of saliks [^1] \
dig their nests in the steep bank under whose frown the \
fisher-boats find no shelter. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sit there on the unfrequented grass, and the \
morning wears on. Tell me what you do on this bank ^so dry that^ \
^it is^ ^a^gap~~ing~~^e^ with cracks? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks in my face and says, "Nothing, nothing \
what-soever."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the river the bank is deserted, and ^no^ \
cattle ~~do not~~ come to water. Only some stray goats from \
the village browse ^the scanty gr~~een~~^ass^^ all day ~~among~~ ~~the scanty gr ~~een~~ ^ass^~~, and [?] \
the solitary water-hawk watches ~~on~~ ^from^ an uprooted peepal [^2] \
aslant ~~upon~~ ^over^ the mud. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sit there alone in the miserly shade of a \
shimool [^3], and the morning wears on. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, for whom do you wait? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks in my face and says, "No one, no one \
~~soever!"~~ ^at all!"^
