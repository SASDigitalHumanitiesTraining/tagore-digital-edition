^I^

~~the~~ great knowledge you have earned ~~may become your burden, and \
though others may learn it from you, yet for the very lack of \
love it may ever remain apart from your own life, like stars \
floating on the night, leaving its virgin darkness unespoused.~~


^- a burden, that though others \
~~?~~ share ~~it?~~ equally with you, will never be lightened, for \
lack of love may it ever remain as foreign to your life, as \
the cold stars are to the unespoused darkness of virgin Night!^
