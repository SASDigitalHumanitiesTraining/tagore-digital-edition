# MS 782/3

[F 59]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was to go away; still she did not speak. But I felt, \
from a slight quiver, her yearning arms would say: "Ah no, \
not yet^!^" ~~.~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often heard her pleading hands vocal in a touch^,^ \
though they knew not what they said. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known those arms to stammer when^,^ had they not^,^ they \
would have become youth's garland round my neck. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little gestures return to remembrance as truants \
escape to play. They are welcomed by all that I know of her, \
in the covert of still hours.
