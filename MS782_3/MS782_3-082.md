~~18.~~ ^21^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father came back from the funeral rites. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boy of seven stood at the window^,^ with eyes wide open \
and a golden amulet hanging from his neck, full of thoughts \
too difficult for his age. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father took him in his arms and the boy asked him, \
"Where is mother?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In heaven," answered ~~the~~ ^his^ father, pointing to the sky. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night the father groaned in slumber, weary with grief. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lamp dimly burned near the bedroom door^,^ and a lizard \
chased moths on the wall. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy woke up from sleep, felt with his hands the \
emptiness in the bed, and stole out to the open terrace. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy raised his eyes to the sky and long gazed in \
silence. His bewildered mind sent abroad into the night the \
question, "Where is heaven?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer came^:^ and the stars seemed like the burning \
tears of tha^t^ ignorant darkness.
