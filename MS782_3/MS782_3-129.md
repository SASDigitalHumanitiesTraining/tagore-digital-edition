^14^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening stood bewildered among street lamps, its gold \
tarnished by the city ~~'s~~ dust. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman, gaudily decked and painted, ~~stood~~ lean ~~ing~~^t^ over \
the rail of ~~a~~ ^her^ balcony, a living fire waiting for its moths. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly an eddy was formed in the road round a street- \
boy crushed under the wheels of a carriage^,^ and the woman ~~i~~^o^n \
the balcony fell ~~down~~ ^to the floor^ screaming ~~on the floor~~ in agony, stricken \
with the grief of the great white-robed Mother who sits in \
the world's inner shrine.
