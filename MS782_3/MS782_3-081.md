[F 195]

~~16.~~ ^20.^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovers come to you, my Queen, and proudly lay their \
riches at your feet^:^ but my tribute is made up of unfulfilled \
hopes. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows have stolen across the heart of my world and the \
best in me has lost light. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the fortunate laugh at my penury, I ask you to lend \
my failings your tears, and so make them precious. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring you a voiceless instrument. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strained to reach a note which was too high in my \
heart, and the string broke. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While masters laugh at the snapped cord, I ask you to \
take my lute in your hands and fill its hollowness with your songs.
