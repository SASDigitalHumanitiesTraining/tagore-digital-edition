&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were living in the royal town of Ujjain, when Kalidas \
was the king's poet, I should know some Malwa girl and fill my [^1] \
thoughts with the music of her name. She would glance at me \
through the slanting shadow of her eyelids, and allow her \
veil to catch in the jasmine as an excuse for lingering near \
me. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very thing happened in some past whose track is lost \
under time's dead leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scholars fight to-day about dates that play hide-and- \
seek. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not break my heart dreaming over flown ^and^ vanished \
ages, but alas and alas again, that those Malwa girls have \
followed them. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what heaven, I wonder, have they carried in their flower \
baskets those days that tingled to the lyrics of the king's poet? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, separation from those whom I was born too \
late to meet weighs on and saddens my heart. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet April carries the same flowers with which they decked \
their hair, and the same south breeze fluttered their veils \
as whispers over modern roses. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to tell the truth, joys are not lacking to this \
spring, though Kalidas sing no more; and I know if he can watch \
me from the Poets' Paradise, he has reasons to be envious.
