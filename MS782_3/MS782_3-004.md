3. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was growing dark when I asked her, "What strange land \
have I come to?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only lowered her eyes, and the water gurgled in the \
throat of her jar, as she walked away. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees hang vaguely over the bank, and the land appears \
as though it already belonged to the past. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water is dumb, the bamboos are darkly still, a \
wristlet tinkles against the water jar from down the lane. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row no more, but fasten the boat to ~~this~~ ^a^ tree, - for I \
love the look of this land. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening star goes down behind the temple dome, and \
the pallor of the marble landing haunts the dark water. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belated wayfarers sigh; for light from hidden windows \
is splintered into the darkness by intervening wayside trees \
and bushes. Still that wristlet tinkles against the water \
jar, and retreating steps rustle from down the lane littered \
with leaves. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night deepens, the palace towers spectre-like \
and the town hums wearily. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row no more, but fasten the boat to a tree. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me seek rest in this strange land, dimly lying under \
the stars, where darkness tingles with the tinkle of a wristlet \
knocking against a water jar.
