&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad you will  not wait for me with that lingering \
pity in your look. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the spell of the night and my farewell words, \
startled at their own tune of despair, which bring these tears \
to my eyes. But day will dawn, my eyes will dry and my heart; \
and there will be no time for weeping. \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who says it is hard to forget? [15]\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercy of death works at life's core, bringing it \
respite from its own foolish persistence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stormy sea is lulled at last in its rocking cradle; \
the forest fire falls to sleep on its bed of ashes. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I shall part, and the cleavage will be hidden \
under living grass and flowers that laugh in the sun.
