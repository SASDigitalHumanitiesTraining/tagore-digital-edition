1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This longing to meet in ^the^ play of love, my Lover, \
is not only mine but ~~also~~ yours. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~For~~ ~~y~~^Y^our lips can ~~only~~ ~~have their~~ smile^,^ ~~and~~ your flute \
~~its~~ ^make^ music only ~~in your~~ ^through^ delight in my love; ~~and~~ therefore \
you are importunate even as I^.^ ~~am.~~

2. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit here ~~on??~~ ^on^ the road; do not ask me to walk further. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~For~~ ~~i~~^I^f your love can be complete without ~~?? then~~ let \
me turn back ~~from my quest of you~~ ^from seeking you^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refuse to beg ~~for you~~ ^a^ sight ^of you^ if you do not feel my \
need. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am blind~~ed~~ with ~~the~~ market dust ~~and~~ ^and^ mid-day glare, \
and ~~I~~ ^so?^ wait ~~, my heart is loved?~~, in ~~the~~ hope^s^ that ~~your ??~~ ^your heart, my heart?^ \
love^r^, ~~shall~~ ^will^ send you to find me , ~~out~~. \
