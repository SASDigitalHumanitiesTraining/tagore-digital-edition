&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name she called me by, like a flourishing jasmine, \
covered the whole seventeen years of our love. With its sound \
mingled the quiver of the light through the leaves, the scent \
of the grass in the rainy night, and the sad silence of the last hour of many an idle day. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the work of God alone was he who answered to that \
name; she created him again for herself during those seventeen \
swift years. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other years were to follow, but their vagrant days, no \
longer fathered within the fold of that name uttered in her \
voice, stray and are scattered. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ask me, "Who should fold us?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find no answer and sit silent, and they cry to me while \
dispersing, "We seek a shepherdess!" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom should they seek? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they do not know. And like derelict evening clouds \
they drift in the trackless dark^,^ and are lost and forgotten.
