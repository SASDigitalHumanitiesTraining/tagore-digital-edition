# MS 782/3

[F 55]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The~~n~~day grew dim^.^ ~~and~~ ~~t~~^T^he early evening star faltered ^near^ \
~~?~~ ~~^on^~~ the edge of ~~the~~ ^a^ grey lonel~~iness~~^y^ ~~of the~~ sky. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked back and felt the road lying behind ^me^ was \
infinitely ~~beyond me~~ ^removed^. ~~Only for once to walk over it and~~ ^Its track through my life had only \
~~never to travel back through the scenes which belonged to~~ ^served for a single journey and was never to be re-travelled \
~~my life~~. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long story of my ~~journey~~ ^coming hither^ lies there dumb in one \
meandering line of dust stretching from the morning ~~'s~~ ~~?~~ ^hill top^ \
~~?~~ to the brink of ~~the~~ bottomless night. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit alone^,^ and wonder if this road is like an instru- \
ment waiting to give up the day's lost voices in music \
when touched by ~~the master~~ ^divine^ fingers at ~~the~~ nightfall.

2.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the rusty iron gratings of the opposite window, \
sits ~~the~~ ^a^ girl, dark and plain of face, ~~looking~~ like a boat \
stranded on ~~the~~ ^a^ sand-bank, when the river is shallow in the \
summer. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to my room after my day's work, and my \
tired eyes are lured to her. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to me like a lake with its dark ^lonely^
water^s^ ~~touched~~ \
~~at the~~ edge^d^ by ~~the ?~~ moon^light^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has only her window for ~~her?~~ freedom, ~~w~~^t^here the \
morning light melts her musings, and ^through it^ her dark eyes, like \
lost stars, ~~seem to swim~~ ^travel^ back to their sky.
