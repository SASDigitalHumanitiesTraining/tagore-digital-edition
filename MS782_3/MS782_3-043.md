~~17.~~ ^15^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot myself for a moment, and I came. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But raise your eyes^,^ and let me know if there still \
linger~~s~~ some shadow of other days, like a pale cloud on the \
horizon that has been robbed of its rain. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment bear with me if I forget myself. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roses are still in bud; they do not yet know how \
we neglect to gather flowers this summer. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning star has the same palpitating hush; the [symbol] \
early light is enmeshed in the branches that overbrow your \
window^,^ as in those other days. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That times are changed, I forget for a little, and have \
come. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget if you ever shamed me by looking away when I \
bared my heart. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only remember the words that stranded on the tremor of \
your lips; I remember in your dark eyes ~~the~~ sweeping shadows \
of passion, like the wings of a home-seeking bird in the dusk. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot that you do not remember, and I come.
