snatched you from Jivaji to whom you had been sacredly \
affianced? I shall never forget that night! In the wedding \
hall we sat anxiously expecting the bridegroom^,^ for the aus- \
picious hour was dwindling away. Then in the distance \
appeared the glare of torches^,^ and bridal strains came floating \
up the air. We shouted for joy^:^ ~~-~~ women blew their conch^-^shells. \
~~Then a~~ ~~next~~ ^A^ procession of palanquins entered the courtyard^:^ but \
while we were asking "W~~w~~here is Jivaji" came to tell us he had \
been waylaid and captured by a Mussulman noble of the Vijapur \
court. That night Jivaji and I touched the nuptial fire and \
swore bloody death to this villain. After waiting long^,^ we \
have been freed from our solemn pledge to-night^:^ ad the spirit \
of Jivaji, who lost his life in this battle, lawfully claims \
you for wife.

Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, it may be that I have disgraced the rites of \
your house, but my honour is unsullied; I loved him to whom \
[thus/yours]I bore ^a^ son. I remember the night when I received two secret \
messages, one from you, one from my mother; your ~~'~~ s said: - \
"I send you the knife; kill him!" My mother's:- "I send you \
the poison; and end your life!" Had unholy force dishonoured me, \
your double bidding had been obeyed. But my body was yielded \
only after love had given me [underlined] - love all the greater, all the \
purer^,^ in that it overcame the hereditary recoil of our blood \
from the Mussulman.
