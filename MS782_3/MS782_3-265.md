[F 109]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world passes by ~~him~~ - ~~the women~~ ^a woman^ to fetch water, \
~~the~~ ^a^ herd-boy with ~~his~~ cattle to ~~the~~ pasture, ~~the~~ ^a^ laden cart \
to the distant market, - and the mother hopes that some \
least stir of life may touch the awful torpor of her dying \
son.

19.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ragged villager, trudging home from the market, \
could suddenly be lifted to the crest of a distant ~~time~~ ^age^, men \
would stop in their work and shout and run to him in delight. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they would ~~not~~ ^no longer^ whittle down the man into ~~a~~ ^the^ peasant, \
but find ~~in~~ him ^full of^ the mystery ~~of life~~ and ~~the~~ spirit of his \
age. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even his poverty and pain would grow ~~?~~ great ^released^ from \
the shallow insult of ~~the limited time~~ ^the present^, and the paltry \
things in his basket would ~~find their~~ ^acquire pathetic^ dignity ~~of pathos~~.
