&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king-fisher sits still on the prow of an empty boat, \
while in the shallow margin of the stream a buffalo lies \
tranquilly blissful, its eyes half closed to savour the luxury \
of cool mud. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undismayed by the barking of the village cur, the cow \
browses on the bank^,^ followed by a hopping group of saliks [underlined] \
hunting moths. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bracket 129/k] I sit in the tamarind grove, where the cries of dumb life \
congregate - the cattle's lowing, the sparrows' chatter, the \
shrill scream of a kite overhead, the crickets' chirp, and the \
splash of a fish in the water. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I peep into the primeval nursey of life, where the \
mother Earth thrills at the first living clutch near her \
breast.
