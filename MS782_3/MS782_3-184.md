~~24.~~ ^5^  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~If I were born~~ ^If I were living^ in the royal town of Ujjain, ~~in these?~~ \
~~days~~ when Kalidas was the king's poet, I should ~~^have?^~~ know ~~,~~ some \
Malwa girl and fill ~~^?^~~ my thoughts with the music of her name.\
She ~~would~~ glance at me, through the slanting shadow of her \
eyelids, and allow her veil to ~~?~~ ^catch^ in the jasmine \
~~branches~~, ~~seeking her chance to~~ ^as an excuse for^ linger^ing near me^. [illegible pencil] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~It was~~ ^This very thing happened^ in some past, whose track is lost under time's \
dead leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scholars fight to-day about dates that play hide \
and seek. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not break my heart ~~over the figures of~~ ^dreaming over flown vanished \
~~years~~ ^ages^, but alas and alas again, that those Malwa girls have \
followed them. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what heaven, I wonder, have they carried, in their 

flower baskets, those days that tingled ~~with~~ ^to the^ lyrics of the \
king's poet? 

This morning^,^ ^separation from those whom I was born too late to meet weighs on and saddens^ ~~is heavy with ~~^and^~~ with saddness of a \
separation from those whom I never met in all time.~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet April carries the same flowers with which they \
decked their hair, and the same south breeze fluttered \
their veils ~~which brings its~~ ^as^ whispers ~~to the~` ^over^ modern roses. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to tell the truth, joys are not lacking ~~in~~ ^to^ the \
~~recent spring time~~ ^this spring^, ~~when~~ ^through^ Kalidas sing ~~s~~ no more; and I \
know ~~that~~, if he can watch me from ~~across~~ the Poets' Para- \
dise, he has reasons to be envious.
