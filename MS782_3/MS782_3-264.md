&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the scene on the barren heath - the girl \
sitting alone on the grass before ~~her~~ ^the^ gispy-camp braiding \
her hair in the afternoon shade. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her little dog jumped and barked at her busy hands, \
~~making light of her employment~~ ^as ^though her employment ~~was of~~ ^had^ no importance^ [?]. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain did she rebuke it, calling it ~~names, saying~~ ^"a pest"^ \
~~that it was a pest, that~~ ^saying^ she was tired of its perpetual \
silliness. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struck it on ~~its~~ ^the^ nose with her reproving fore- \
finger which ^only^ seemed to ~~amuse~~ ^delight^ it ~~all~~ the more. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked menacingly grave for a few moments ~~in~~ ^to warn it^ \
~~warning~~ of ~~its~~ impending doom, and then, ~~leaving her hair~~ ^letting her hair fall^, \
~~alone she~~ quickly snatched it up in her arms, laughed and \
pressed it to her heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is tall and lean, withered to the bone with long \
repeated fever. Like a dead tree ~~he seems~~ unable to draw ~~in~~ \
a single drop of ~~joy ?~~ sap from ~~all existence~~ ~~^?^~~ ^anywhere^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In despairing patience, his mother carries him like a \
child ~~and brings him out~~ into the sun where he sits by the \
roadside in the shortening shadows of ~~the~~ ^each^ forenoon.
