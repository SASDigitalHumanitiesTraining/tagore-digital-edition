&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river is grey and the air dazed with blown sand. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a morning of dark disquiet, when the birds are mute \
and their nests shake in the gust, I sit alone and ask myself, \
"Where is she?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days have flown wherein we sat too near each other; \
we laughed and jested, and the awe of love's majesty found no \
words at our meetings. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made myself small, and she trifled away every moment \
with pelting ~~of?~~ talk. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day I wish in vain that she were by me, in the gloom \
of the coming storm, to sit in the soul's solitude.
