&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For once be careless, timid traveller, and utterly \
lose your ~~path~~ ^way^; ~~let the wide-awake light of your day be~~  ^wide awake though you are, be like broad day-light^ \
~~waylaid by the lure of mist.~~ ~~^and entangledin^~~ ^enticed ^by^ and melted in mist.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not shun the garden of Lost Hearts waiting at \
the end of the wrong road, where the grass is strewn with \
wrecked red flowers, and disconsolate water heaves in the \
troubled sea. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long have you watched over the store gathered by \
weary years. Let it be stripped with nothing remaining \
but the desolate triumph of losing all.
