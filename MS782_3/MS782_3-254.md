&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ferry-boat plies between the two villages facing \
each other ~~over~~ ^across^ the narrow stream. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~It is not for to cross~~ ^The water is niether wide^, nor deep - a mere break in \
the path that ~~sweetens~~ ^enhances^ the small adventures of daily life, \
~~like a stream of tune to which words give way in joy.~~ ^like a break in the words of a song across which the tune gleefully streams.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While towers of wealth rise high ~~come down~~ ^crash^ to their \
ruin, the^se^ ~~the~~ villages talk to each other across the garru- \
lous stream, and the ferry-boat plies between them, age \
after age, from ~~the seasons of~~ seed ~~-sowing~~^-time^ to ~~the season~~ \
~~of~~ harvest.
