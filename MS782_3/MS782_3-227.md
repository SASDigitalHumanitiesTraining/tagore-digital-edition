~~34.~~ ^16.^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovers come to you, my Queen, and proudly lay their \
riches at your feet^:^ but my tribute is made up of ~~hopes~~ \
unfulfilled ~~.~~ ^hopes.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows have stolen ~~into~~ ^across^ the heart of my world and \
the best in me has lost ~~its~~ light. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the fortunate laugh~~s~~ at my penury, I ask you \
to lend my failings your tears, ~~making~~ ^and so make them^ precious ~~their in \
completeness~~. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The instrument~~ I bring ~~to~~ you ~~is silent~~ ^a voiceless instrument^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~You know I neither trifled nor strayed from the path~~ \
I strained to reach ~~the~~ ^a^ note which was too high in \
my heart, and ~~this~~ the string broke. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While masters laugh at the snapped cord~~s~~, I ask you \
to take my lute in your hands and fill ^its hollowness^ with your ~~own~~ songs. \
~~the emptiness of its music.~~ 

pencil note: and fill its hollowness with \
your songs
