Rama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how to die without flinching? 

Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do. 

Rama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then let the funeral fire be lighted for you! See, there \
lies the body of your husband. 

Ama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jivaji? 

Rama. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Jivaji. He was you husband ~~,~~ by plighted troth. \
The baffled fire of the nuptial God has raged into the hungry \
fire of death, and the interrupted wedding shall be completed \
now. 

Vinayaka. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not listen, my child. Go back to your son, to your \
own nest darkened with sorrow. My duty has been performed to \
its extreme cruel end, and nothing now remains for you to do. ^-^ \
Wife, your grief is fruitless. Were the branch dead ~~,~~ which \
was violently snapped from our tree, I should give it to the \
fire. But it has sent living roots into a new soil and is \
bearing flowers and fruits. Allow her, without regret, to \
obey the laws of those among whom she has loved.
Come, wife, \
it is time we cut all wordly ties and spent our remainder \
lives in the seclusion of some peaceful pilgrim shrine.
