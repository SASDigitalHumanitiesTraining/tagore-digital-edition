[ital] [Night on the battlefield: AMA meets her father VINAYAKA. (names underlined)]
Ama. \
Father! 

Vinayaka. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shameless wanton, you call me "Father"! you who did not \
shrink  from a Mussulman husband! 

Ama. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you have treacherously killed my husband, yet you \
are my father; and I hold back a widow's tears^,^ lest they bring \
God's curse on you. Since we have met on this battlefield \
after years of separation^,^ let me bow to your feet and take my \
last leave! 

Vinayaka. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will you go, Ama? The tree on which you built your \
impious nest is hewn down. Where will you [underlined] take shelter? 

Ama.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my son. 

Vinayaka.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave him^!^ Cast never a fond look back on the result of \
a sin sxpiated with blood^!^ Thing where to go. 

Ama. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death's open gates are wider that a father's love!
