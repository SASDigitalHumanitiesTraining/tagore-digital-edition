19. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we two first met my heart rang out in music, "She \
who is eternally afar is beside you for ever". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That music is silent, because I have grown to believe \
that my love is only near^,^ and have forgotten that she is also \
far^,^ far away. \
[65/7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music fills the infinite between two ^[^souls. This has \
been muffled by the mist of our daily habits. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On shy summer nights, when the breeze brings a vast murmur \
out of the silence, I sit up in my bed and mourn the great loss \
of her who is beside me. I ask myself, "When shall I have \
another chance to whisper to her words with the rhythm of \
eternity in them?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up, my song, from thy languor, rend this screen of \
the familiar, and fly to my beloved ~~,~~ there, in the endless sur- \
prise of our first meeting ~~.~~ ^!^
