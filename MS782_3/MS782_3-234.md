~~7.~~ ^24^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was walking along ~~the~~ ^a^ path over-grown with grass \
when suddenly I heard from someone behind, "See if you know me." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned round and looked at her and said, "I cannot \
remember your name." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, "I am th~~e~~^at^ first great ~~s~~^S^orrow ^whom^ you met when \
you were young." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes looked like the morning, whose dew was still \
in the air. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood silent for some time till I said, "Have you \
lost all the great burden of your tears?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said nothing. I felt that her tears \
had ^had^ time to learn the language of smile^s^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once you ~~?~~ said," - she whispered, "that you would \
cherish your grief for ever". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blushed and said, "Yes, but years have passed and \
I forget". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I took her hand in mine and said, "But you have \
changed". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was sorrow once, has now become peace," she \
said.
