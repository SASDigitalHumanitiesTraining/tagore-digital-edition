~~2.~~ ^2^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the rusty iron gratings of the opposite window sits \
a girl, dark and plain of face, like a boat stranded on a sand- \
bank ~~.~~ when the river is shallow in the summer. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to my room after my day's work, and my tired \
eyes are lured to her. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to me like a lake with its dark lonely waters \
edged by moonlight. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has only her window for freedom^:^ there the morning \
light melts her musings, and through it her dark eyes ~~.~~ like \
lost stars ~~.~~ travel back to their sky.
