28.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad ~~that~~ you ~~do~~ ^will^ not wait for me with th~~e~~^at^ linger- [?] \
ing pity in your look. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the spell of the night and my farewell \
words, startled at their own tune of despair, which bring \
these tears to my eyes. But ~~the~~ day will dawn, my eyes \
will dry and my heart; and there will be no time for weeping. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who says it is hard to forget? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercy of death works at life's core, bringing ^it^ \
~~it~~ respite from its ~~own~~ ^own^ foolish persistence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm^y^ ~~in the~~ sea is lulled at last in its rocking \
cradle; the forest fire falls to sleep on its bed of ashes. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I shall part, and the cleavage will be hidden \
under ~~the~~ living grass and flowers ^that^ laugh~~ing~~ in the sun.
