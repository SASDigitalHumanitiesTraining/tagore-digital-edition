&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went away when the night was about to wane. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mind tried to console me by saying, "All is vanity". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt angry and said, "That unopened letter with her \
name on it, and this palm-leaf fan bordered with red silk by \
her own hands, are they not real?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day passed^,^ and my friend came and said to me, "What- \
ever is good is true, and can never perish". [/19] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" I asked impatiently, "was not this body \
good which is now lost to the world?"" \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fretful child
hurting its own mother, I tried to \
wreck all the shelters that ever I had, in and about me, and \
cried, "This world is treacherous". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly I felt a voice saying - "Ungrateful!" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked out of the window^,^ and a reproach seemed to come \
from the star-sprinkled night, - "You pour out into the void \
of my absence your faith in the truth that I came!"
