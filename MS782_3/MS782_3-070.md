&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe you had visited me in a vision before we ever \
met, like some foretaste of April before the spring broke \
into flower. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That vision must have come when all was bathed in the \
odour of sal [underlined] blossom; when the twilight twinkle of the river \
fringed its yellow sands ~~:~~ ^,^ and the vague sounds of a summer \
afternoon were blended; yes, and had it not laughed and \
evaded me in many a nameless gleam at other moments?
