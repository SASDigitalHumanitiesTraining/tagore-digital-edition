[F 13]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adored are you of all men in all ages, Urvashi, O endless \
wonder. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world throbs with youthful pain at the glance of your \
eyes, the ascetic lays the fruit of his austerities at your \
feet, the songs of poets hum and swarm round the perfume of \
your presence. Your feet, as in careless joy, they flit on ^,^ \
~~even~~ wound ^even^ the heart of the hollow wind with the tinkle of \
golden bells. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you dance before the gods, flinging ~~new~~ orbits of ^new^ \
rhythm into space, Urvashi, the earth shivers leaf and grass, \
and ^autumn fields^ heave~~s~~ and sway~~s~~ ~~autumn fields~~; the sea surges into a \
frenzy of rhyming waves, the stars drop into the sky, beads \
from the chain that swings ^tosses?^ ^leaps?^ till it break~~s~~ on your breast and \
the blood dances in men's hearts with sudden turmoil. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the first break on the crest of heaven's slumber, \
Urvashi, you thrill the air with unrest. The world bathes \
your limbs in her tears; with ~~the~~ colour of her heart's blood \
are your feet red; lightly you poise on the wave-tossed lotus \
of desire, Urvashi, you play forever in that limitless mind, \
wherein labours God's tumultuous dream.
