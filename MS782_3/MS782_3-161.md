&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes feel the deep peace of this sky^,^ and there stirs \
through me what a tree feels when it holds its leaves like \
cups to be filled with sunshine. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought rises in my mind, like the warm breath from \
grass in the sun; it mingles with the gurgle of lapping \
water and the sigh of weary wind in village lanes^,^ - the \
thought that I have lived along with the whole life of this \
world and have given to it my own love and sorrows.
