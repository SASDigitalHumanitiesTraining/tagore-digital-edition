&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tenant ha~~d~~^s^ come to occupy a ~~part of the house. His~~ ^few rooms^. \
^He^ earn~~ing~~^s^ ~~is small~~ ^little^ and ^has many^ children ~~?~~. The tired mother \
beats them ~~in anger~~, and they roll on the floor and shriek.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid-servant of forty drudg~~ing~~^es^ through the day, \
quarrels with ~~the~~ ^her^ mistress, threatens to ~~leave~~, but never \
leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day some small repairs are done. Paper is pasted \
in place of missing panes; gaps in the railings are made good \
~~by~~ ^with^ split bamboo ~~pieces~~; ~~the gate, with is bolt closest, is~~ ^an empty box keeps the boltless gate shut^ \
~~kept shut with an empty box; the walls through a new coating~~ ^old stains vaguely show through new^ \
~~of whitewash vaguely ? their stains.~~ ^whitewash on the walls^. \
[crossed out ???? can't read] ~~But devices of petty resource \
try to hide it in dubious decency and its dignity is outraged.~~ \
[moved from bottom] ^The magnificence of wealth had found a fitting memorial in \
gaunt desolation, but, lacking sufficient means they try to hide \
this with dubious devices and its dignity is outraged.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ^have^ overlooked the deserted room on the north side. \
And its forlorn door still bangs in the wind like ~~the~~ ^Despair^ beat- \
ing ~~of the~~ ^her^ breast ~~of despair~~.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have overlooked the deserted room on the north side. \
And its forlorn door still bangs in the wind^,^ like Despair \
beating her breast.
