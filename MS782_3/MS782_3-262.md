her companions ~~from~~ below ~~her~~ ^the^ window. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She timidly went down the dark stairs holding a lamp \
in her hand, guarding it behind her veil. \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lamp had gone out in the dark^,^ spiral ~~of the~~ stair^case^. \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~She said~~ ~~f~~^F^rom below ^she answered^ in distress, "Father, I ~~miss?~~ ^have lost^ \
myself."
