equals are enemies. They are obstacles ahead, they are terrors \
from behind. There is no place for brothers or friends in a \
king's polity; its one solid foundation is conquest. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refuse to call a conquest what was won by fraud in \
gambling.

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man is not shamed by refusing to challenge a tiger on \
equal terms with teeth and nails. Our weapons are those proper \
for success, not for suicide. Father, I am proud of
the result \
and disdain regret for the means. 

Dhritarshtra. \
But justice - - 

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fools alone dream of justice ~~;~~ ^-^ success is not yet theirs: \
but those born to rule rely on power, merciless and unhampered \
with scruples. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your success will bring down on you a loud and angry flood \
of detraction. 

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people will take amazingly little time to learn that \
Duryodhana is king and has power to crush calumny
under foot.
