^18^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the morning he came out to walk a road shaded by \
a file of deodars [underlined], ~~and~~ ^that^ coiled ^the hill^ round ~~a hill~~ like importunate \
love. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the first letter from his newly-wedded wife in \
their village home, begging him to come to her, and come soon. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touch of an absent hand haunted him as he walked, \
and the air seemed to take up the cry of the letter: "Love, \
my love, my sky is brimming with tears ~~"~~ ^!"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked himself in wonder, "How do I deserve this?" \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun suddenly appeared over the rim of the blue hills^,^ \
and four girls from a foreign shore came with swift strides, \
talking loud and followed by a barking dog. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elder turned ~~from~~ ^away to conceal their amusement at^ something strange in his \
insignificance, and the younger ones pushed each other, laughed \
aloud and ran off in exuberant mirth. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and his head sank. Then he suddenly felt his \
letter, opened and read it again.
