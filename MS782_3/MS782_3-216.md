&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe you~~r~~ ~~vision~~ ^had come to me^ ^in a vision^ before we ever \
met, like some prophecy of April before the spring broke in^to^ \
flower~~s~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~It~~ ^The vision^ came ~~in the haze of~~ ^when all was hazed in^ the odour of sal blossom~~s~~; \
~~in~~ ^when^ the twilight twinkle of the river ~~by~~ ^? its^ the yellow ~~of its~~ \
sands; ~~in the vagueness of~~ ^and sounds were^ blended ~~sounds of~~ ^by^ a summer \
afternoon; ^you ?^ it had laughed and evaded me in many a nameless \
gleam ~~of moments~~ ^at other moments^. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^I believe you had visited me in a vision \
before we ever met, like some ~~?~~ foretaste ~~?~~ \
of April before the spring broke into flower. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That vision must have come when all was ~~hazed~~ ^bathed^ \
in the odour of sal [underlined] blossom; when the twilight twinkle \
of the river fringed its yellow sands; and the ^vague^ sounds \
of a summer afternoon were ~~vaguely?~~ blended ~~and~~ \
~~vague~~; yes, and had it not laughed and evaded \
me in many a nameless gleam at other moments?^
