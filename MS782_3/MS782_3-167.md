&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were your songs, my bird, when you spent your \
night^s^ in the nest? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ~~it~~ not ~~thence that~~ all your pleasure ~~was~~ stored ^therein^ ? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes you lose your heart to the sky - the sky \
that is ~~limitless~~ ^boundless^? 

Answer. [underlined, ital] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~When~~ ^While^ I rested ~~among things limited~~ ^within bounds^ I ~~had my pleasure~~ ^was content^. \
