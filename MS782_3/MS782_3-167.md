and I, the proud servant, bring the invitation with all \
ceremony.

3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~All day~~ I have travelled ^all day^ ~~till I~~ ^and^ was tired, ~~and~~ ^then^ I bowed \
my head towards your kingly court ~~which~~ still ~~remained~~ far \
away. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night deepened, a longing burned in my heart; ~~??~~ \
~~??~~ whatever ^the words^ I sang, ~~it cried of pain~~ ~~pain cried them~~, for ^even^ my songs ~~were a~~ thirst^ed^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O~~h~~ my lover, my Beloved, my best in the all the world ~~.~~ ^!^ 
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When time seemed lost in darkness thy hand dropped \
its sceptre to take up the lute and strike the uttermost \
chords; and my heart sang out, O~~h~~ my Lover, My Beloved, \
my best in all the world^!^ \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, who is this whose arms enfold me? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever I have to leave let me leave, and whatever \
I have to bear let me bear. Only let me walk with thee, O~~h~~ \
my Lover, my Beloved, my best in all the world^!^ \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descend at whiles from thine audience hall, come down \
amid joys and sorrows; ~~and~~ hid~~ing~~^e^ in all forms and delight~~s~~, \
in love and in my heart, sing thy songs, O~~h~~ my Lover, my \
Beloved, my best in all the world^!^
