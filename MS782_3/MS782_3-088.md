~~24.~~ ^27^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was walking along a path over-grown with grass^,^ \
when suddenly I heard from someone behind, "See if you know \
me." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned round and looked at her and said, "I cannot \
remember your name." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, "I am that first great Sorrow whom you met \
when you were young." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes looked like ~~the~~ ^a^ morning, whose dew ~~was~~ ^is^ still in \
the air. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood silent for some time till I said, "Have you lost \
all the great burden of your tears?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said nothing. I felt that her tears had \
had time to learn the language of smiles. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once you said" ~~,~~ she whispered, "that you would cherish \
your grief for ever". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blushed and said, "Yes, but years have passed and I \
forget". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I took her hand in mine and said, "But you have changed". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was sorrow once, has now become peace," she said.
