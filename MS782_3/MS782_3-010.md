9.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stand before my window with those hungry eyes \
and beg for my secret. It is but a tiny stone of glistening \
pain streaked with ~~a~~ blood-red ^by?^[^1] ~~of~~ passion. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What gifts have you brought in both ~~your~~ hands to fling \
before me in the dust? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear, if I accept, to create a debt that can never be \
paid even by the loss of all I have. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stand before my window with your youth and flowers \
to shame my destitute life.
