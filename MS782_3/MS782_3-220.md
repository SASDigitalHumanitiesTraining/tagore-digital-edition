&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence do you bring ~~your~~ ^this^ ~~un~~^dis^quiet, my love? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let my heart touch yours and kiss ~~but~~ the pain ~~from~~ ^out of^ \
your silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has thrown ~~out of~~ ^us from^ its depth this little ^hour^ \
~~time~~ ~~for~~ ^that^ love ~~to~~ ^may^ build a new world^,^ within ~~our~~ ^these^ shut doors, ^and^ \
lighted by this solitary lamp. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have for ~~our~~ music but a single reed ~~to share~~ ^which our two pairs^ \
~~between our lips~~ ^of lips must play on by turns^ ^: -^ for ~~our~~ crown only one garland to bind \
my hair after I have put it on your forehead. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearing the veil from my breast I shall make our bed \
on the floor; and one kiss and one sleep of ~~bliss~~ ^delight^ shall \
fill our small ^boundless^ world ~~that is boundless~~.
