&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day came for the image from the temple to be drawn \
round the holy town in its chariot. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen said to the King, "Let us go and attend the \
festival". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one ~~in~~ ^man out of^ the whole household did not join in the pil- \
grimage. His work was to collect the stalks of spear-grass \
to make brooms for the king's house. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the servants said in pity to him, [circled] "You may \
come with us". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head^,^ saying ~~,~~ "It cannot be". \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man dwelt by the road along which the king's followers \
had to pass. And when the Minister's elephant reached this \
spot, he called to him and said: "Come with us and see the \
God ride in his chariot ~~"~~ ^!"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dare not seek God after the king's fashion" said \
the man. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How should you ever have such luck again as to see the \
God in his chariot?" asked the Minister. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When God himself comes to my door" ~~,~~ answered the man. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister laughed loud and said, "Fool! 'When God \
comes to your door!' yet a king must travel to see him!" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~"That shows how poor I am"~~ ^"Who except God visits the poor?"^ said the man.
