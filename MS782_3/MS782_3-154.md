~~I.~~ ^27^ \
[132-> 130] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was said that in the forest near the meeting of river \
and lake, certain fairies lived in disguise who are only recognised \
^as fairies^ after they have fled away. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Prince went to this forest ~~,~~ and^,^ when he came where river \
met lake^,^ he saw a village girl sitting on the bank ruffling the \
water to make the lillies dance. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~And~~ ~~h~~^H^e asked her in a whisper, "Tell me what fairy art thou?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl laughed at the question and the hillsides echoed her \
mirth. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince thought she was the laughing fairy of the waterfall.

~~VI.~~ [break of one line only] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News reached the King that the prince had married a fairy: he \
sent horses and men and brought them to his house. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen saw the bride and turned her face away in disgust, the \
Prince's sister flushed red with annoyance, and the maids asked if \
that was how fairies dressed. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince whispered, "Hush, my fairy has come to our house in \
disguise." 

~~VII.~~ [ditto] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the yearly festival the Queen said to her son, \
"Ask your bride not to shame us before our kinsfolk who are coming \
to see the fairy." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Prince said to his bride, "For my love's sake show thy \
true self to my people." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long she sat silent^,^ then nodded her promise while tears ran \
down her cheeks.
