&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two little bare feet flit on the earth, (pencil notes?) carrying the \
^that^ metaphor ~~of~~ ^"the^ summer's ^flowering^ footfall ~~s of flowers.~~
[above all crossed out] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^Two little bare feet flit over the ground, and \
seen to embody that metaphor "Flowers are the foot ~~falls~~ ^prints^ \
of summer"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lightly impress on the dust the ~~??~~ ~~^??^~~ ^chronicle^ of their \
adventure, to be ~~wiped away~~ ^erased^ by ~~the~~ ^a^ passing breeze. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~But~~ ~~c~~^C^ome stray~~ing~~ into my heart, ~~two~~ ^you^ ^tender little ~~tender~~ \
feet, and ~~let your steps~~ leave ~~an~~ ^the^ everlasting ~~marl~~ ^print^ of song~~s~~^s^ \
~~in~~ ^on^ my dreamland path.
