&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said that Kabir, the weaver, was favoured of God, \
and the crowd flocked round him for medicine and miracles. \
~~And it~~ ^But he was^ troubled^;^ ~~? to find that~~ his low birth ~~should lose~~ ^had hitherto endowed him with a^ \
~~its~~ ^most^ precious obscurity ~~which was for him~~ to ~~made~~ sweet^en^ \
with songs and with the presence of his God. ^He prayed that it might be restored^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envious of the repute of this outcaste, the priests \
leagued themselves with a harlot to ~~drag him to~~ disgrace ^him^. \
Kabir came to the market to sell cloths from his ~~?~~ loom^.^ \
~~when~~ ^when^ the woman grasped ~~him by~~ his hand, blaming him for being \
faithless ~~to her~~, and followed him to his house, saying she \
would not be forsaken ~~?~~^,^ Kabir said to himself, "God \
answers prayers in his own way". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~And then~~ ^Soon^ the woman felt a shiver of fear and fell on \
her knees and cried, "Save me from my sin!" To which he \
said, "Open your life to God's light." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabir worked at his loom and sang ~~as he worked~~, and \
his songs washed ~~away~~ ^the^ stains from th~~e~~^at^ woman's heart and ^by way^ \
^of^ return found ~~their dwelling~~ ^a home^ in her sweet voice. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day the king, in a fit of caprice, sent a message \
to Kabir to come and sing before him. ~~He~~ ^The weaver^ shook his head: \
but the messenger dared not leave his door till his master's \
errand was fulfilled.
