&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind shook ~~its?~~ ^his^ head and said, ~~"But where are~~ ^There are niether^ banners \
~~and~~ ^nor^ pageantry^!^" \
III. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night waned, the stars paled in the sky. Suddenly \
the touchstone of the morning light tinged everything with \
gold. A cry spread from mouth to mouth - \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the herald."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bowed my head and asked, "Is he coming?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer seemed to burst from all sides, "Yes". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind grew troubled and said, "The dome of my building \
is not yet finished ~~and things are not arranged~~ ^nothing is in order^." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice came from the sky, "Pull down your building." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why?" asked Mind. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because to-day is the day of the ~~c~~^C^oming, and your \
building ~~obstructs the space~~ ~~??~~ ^is in the way^."

IV. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ~~great tower~~ ^lofty building^ lies in the dust and ~~things are~~ ^all is^ \
scattered and broken. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind looked about.But what was there to see? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the morning star and the lily washed in dew. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what else? A child running ~~out~~ laughing from \ its mother's arms into the open light. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was it only for this that they said it was the \
day of the ~~c~~^C^oming?" \
