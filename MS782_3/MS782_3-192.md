27.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You desired my love and yet you did not love me. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore my life clings to you like a chain ~~whose~~ ^of which^ \
clank and ~~clasp~~ ^grip^ grow harsher the more you struggle to be free. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My despair has become your deadly companion clutching \
at the faintest of your favours, trying to drag you away \
into the cavern of tears. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have shattered my freedom and with its wreck \
built your own prison.
