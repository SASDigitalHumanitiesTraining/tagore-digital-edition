&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often, great Earth, have I felt my being yearn to \
flow over you, sharing in the happiness of each gr~~ass~~^een^ blade \
that raises its signal banner in answer to the beckoning blue \
of the sky. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel as if I had belonged to you ages before I was born. \
That is why, in the days when the autumn light shimmers on \
the mellowing ears of rice, I seem to remember a past when my \
mind was everywhere, and even to hear voices as of playfellows \
echoing from the remote and deeply-veiled past. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, in the evening, the cattle return to their folds, \
raiding dust from the meadow paths, as the moon rises higher \
than the smoke ascending from the village huts, I feel sad as \
for some great separation~~,?~~ that happened in the first morning \
of existence.
