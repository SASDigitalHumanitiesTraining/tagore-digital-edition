^11^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sleepy village, the moon was still like a sunny \
midnight when my holidays came to their end. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little girl of four had followed me all the morning \
from room to room^,^ watching my preparations in grave silence^,^ \
till^,^ wearied^,^ she sat by the door-post strangely quiet, mur- \
muring to herself, "Father must not go ~~"~~ ^!"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the meal hour^,^ when sleep daily overcame her, \
but her mother had forgotten her and the child was too unhappy \
to complain. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last^,^ when I stretched out my arms to her to say \
farewell, she never moved, but sadly looking at me said, \
"Father^,^ you must not go ~~"~~ ^!"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it amused me to tears to think how this little child \
dared to fight the giant world of necessity with no other \
resource than those few words, "Father, you must not go ~~.?"~~ ^!"^
