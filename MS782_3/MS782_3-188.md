9. [pencil note: The man speaks?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stand before my window with those hungry eyes \
and beg for my secret. It is but a tiny ~~gem~~ ^stone^ of glistening \
pain ~~crossed by~~ ^streaked with^ a blood-red ~~streak~~ of passion. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What gifts have you brought in both your hands to fling \
before me in the dust? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear ~~to~~ ^if I^ accept ~~this debt, lest I may~~ ^to create a debt that can^ never ^be^ pa~~y~~^id^ \
~~it back while losing all that is mine~~ ^even by the loss of all I have.^
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stand before my window with your youth and flowers \
to shame my destitute life.
