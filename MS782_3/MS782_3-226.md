~~22.~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we two first met my heart rang out in music, \
"She who is eternally ~~away~~ ^afar^ is ~~near to~~ ^beside^ you for ever". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That music is silent, because I have grown to believe \
that my love is only near^,^ and have forgotten that she is \
also ~~away~~ ^far^,^ far away^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Who~~ ^Music fills^ ~~the~~ ^the^ infinit~~y~~^e^ between two soul ~~fills ? with music~~. \
~~It~~ ^This^ has been ~~smothered~~ ^muffled^ ~~for us~~ by the mist of ^our^ daily habits. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~In some~~ ^On^ shy summer nights, when the breeze brings \
~~the~~ ^a^ vast murmur ~~of the mute~~ ^out of the silence^, I sit up in my bed and mourn \
the great loss of her who is ~~by~~ ^beside^ me. I ask myself, "When \
shall I have ^another^ chance ~~again~~ to whisper to her words ~~that have~~ ^with the rhythm^ \
~~the melody of all time~~ ^of eternity in them^?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up, my song, from thy languor, rend this screen \
of the familiar, and ~~reach~~ ^fly to^ my beloved ~~,~~ ^there^, in the endless~~ness of~~ \
~~the~~ ~~first~~ surprise of our ^first^ meeting. 

pencil note: thus: fly to my beloved, there, in the endless \
surprise of our first meeting.
