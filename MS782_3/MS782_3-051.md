Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked in surprise who you were, and you meekly answered \
that you were the son of Vrihaspati, a divine sage at the \
court of the God Indra, and desired to learn from my father \
that secret spell which can revive the dead. 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feared lest the Master, the teacher of the Titans, \
those rivals of the Gods, should refuse to accept me for a \
disciple. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he could not refuse me when I pleaded your cause, \
so greatly he loves his daughter. 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice had the jealous Titan slain me, and thrice you \
prevailed on your father to bring me back to life^:^ therefore \
my gratitude can never die. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gratitude! Forget all - I shall not grieve. Do you \
only remember benefits? Let them perish! If after the day's \
lessons, in the evening solitude, some strange tremor of joy \
shook your heart, remember that - but not gratitude. If, as \
someone passed, a snatch of song got tangled among your texts \
or the swing of a robe fluttered your studies with delight, \
remember that when at leisure in your ~~p~~^P^aradise. What, benefits \
only! - and neither beauty nor love nor aught else?
