&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, Spring, reckless lover of the earth, make the \
forest^'s^ heart pant ~~with the urge of~~ ^for^ utterance. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come in gusts of disquiet ~~along~~ ^where^ flowers ~~on threek~~ ^break open^ \
and ~~hustle of~~ ^jostle the^ new leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst, like a rebellion of light, into the night's \
vigil, into the lake's dark dumbness, into the dungeon ~~of~~ ^under^ \
^the^ dust, proclaiming freedom to the shackled seeds. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like laughter of lightning, like the shout of a \
storm, break into the midst of the noisy town, ~~into~~ ^free^ ~~the~~ \
stifled word~~s~~ and ^unconscious^ effort~~s~~, ~~unawake, into the~~ ^reinforce our^ flagging fight, \
and conquer death.

^thus: free stifled word and unconscious effort, ~~?~~ \
re-inforce our flagging fight, and conquer death^
