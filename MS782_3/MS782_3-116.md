^I^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[bracket]Come, [underline x2] Spring, reckless lover of the earth, make the \
forest's heart pant for utterance. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come in gusts of disquiet where flowers break open and \
jostle the new leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst, like a rebellion of light, ~~into~~ ^through^ the night's vigil, \
~~into~~ ^through^ the lake's dark dumbness, ~~into~~ ^through^ the dungeon under the \
dust, proclaiming freedom to the shackled seeds. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ^the^ laughter of lightning, like the shout of a storm, \
break into the midst of the noisy town; free stifled word \
and unconscious effort, reinforce our flagging
fight, and \
conquer death.
