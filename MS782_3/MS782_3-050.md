Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bow to thee, Lord of the Forest! Remember me, when [slash] \
under thy shade other students chant their lessons to an \
accompaniment of bees ~~'~~ humming and leaves ~~'~~ rustling. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not forget our Venumati^,^ whose swift water is one \
stream of singing love. 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall ever remember her, the dear companion of my exile, \
who, like a busy village girl, smiles on her errand of cease- \
less service and croons a simple song.

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, friend, let me also remind you that you had another \
companion whose thoughts were vainly busy to make you forget \
an exile's cares. 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of her has become a part of my life. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall the day when, little more than a boy, you first \
arrived. You stood there, near the hedge of the garden, a \
smile in your eyes. 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I saw you
gathering flowers ~~,~~ ^-^ clad in white, like the \
dawn bathed in radiance. And I said "Make me proud by allowing \
me to help you^!^"
