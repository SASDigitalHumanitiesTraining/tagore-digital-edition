Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so much bitterness! Smile, and give me leave to go. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile! But, my friend, this is not your native Paradise. \
Smiles are not so cheap in this world^,^ where thirst^,^ like a worm \
in the flower, gnaws at the heart's core; where baffled desire \
hovers round the desired, and memory never ceases to sigh \
foolishly after vanished joy. 

Kacha. [two lines above] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devayani, tell me how I have offended^?^

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it so easy for you to leave this forest^,^ which through \
long years has lavished on you shade and song^?^ Do you not \
feel how the wind wails through [slash] these ^gl^immering shadows^,^ and \
dry leaves whirl in the air, like ghosts of lost hope^;^ - while \
you alone^,^ who part from us^,^ have a smile on your lips? 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This forest has been a second mother ~~-land~~ to me^,^ for here \
I have been born again. My love for it shall never dwindle. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you had driven the cattle to graze on the lawn, \
yonder banyan tree spread an hospitable shade for your tired \
limbs against the midday heat.
