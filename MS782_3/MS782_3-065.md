# MS 782/3

[F 178]

3. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the day. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy shower of rain ~~was~~ ^is^ slackening into fitful \
pauses, renewed gusts of wind startle it from a first lull. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take up my instrument. Idly I touch the strings, till, \
without my knowing,  the music borrows the mad cadence of that \
storm. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see her figure as she steals from her work, stops at \
my door, and retreats with hesitating steps. She comes again^,^ \
stands outside leaning against the wall, then slowly enters \
the room and sits down. With head bent, she plies her needle \
in silence; but soon stops her work, and looks out of the \
window ~~.~~ through the rain, at the blurred line of trees. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this - one hour of a rainy noon filled with shadows \
and song and silence.
