&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The flaming scimitar of the hill-stream lies~~ ^The hill stream like a flaming scimitar having been^ sheathed \
~~in evening gloom~~ ^in gloom by the evening^, ~~then~~ suddenly a flock of birds passes over- \
head, their loud-laughing wings hurling their flight like \
an arrow among stars. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It startles a passion ~~of~~ ^for^ speed in the heart of ~~the~~ ^all^ \
motionless ^things^, ~~and for the moment~~ the hills seem to feel in \
their bosom the anguish of ~~the~~ storm-clouds, and ~~the~~ trees \
long to break their rooted shackles. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me the flight of these birds has rent a veil of \
stillness revealing an immense flutter in ~~the bottom of~~ \
this ^deep^ silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see these hills and forests flying across time to \
the unknown, and darkness thrilling into fire ~~with wings~~ ^as the stars^ \
~~beats of stars~~ ^wing by^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel in my own being the rush of the sea-crossing \
bird, ~~winging its~~ ^cleaving a^ way beyond the limits of life and death, \
while the migrant world cries ~~in its~~ ^with a^ myriad voices, "Not \
here, but somewhere else, in the bosom of the Far-away".
