&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you dance before the gods, flinging new ~~stars~~ ^orbits^ of \
rhythm into space, Urvashi, the earth shivers ~~in its~~ lea~~ves~~^f^ \
and grass, and heaves and sways ~~in its~~ ^under^ autumn fields; the \
sea surges into a frenzy of rhyming waves, the stars drop \
in ^to^ the sky^,^ ^beads^ from the ~~swing ??~~ chain ^that swings till it breaks^ on your breast and the \
blood dances in men's hearts ~~in a~~ ^with^ sudden ~~meaningless~~ turmoil. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the first ~~^waking?^~~ break ~~of awaking~~ on the crest of \
heaven's slumber, Urvashi ~~who~~ ^you^ thrill the air with unrest. \
The world bathes your limbs in ~~its~~ ^her^ tears; with the colour \
of ~~its~~ ^her^ heart's blood ^are^ your feet ~~are~~ red; lightly you poise \
~~yourself~~ on the wave-tossed lotus of desire, Urvashi, ^you play^ \
~~whose endlessday to~~ ^forever^ in ^that^ limitless mind, where ~~??~~ ^in labours^ \
God's tumultuous dream ~~^is wordly? ??^~~
