~~39.~~ ^25^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our life sails on the uncrossed sea whose waves ^chase 
each other^ in \
an eternal hide-and-seek ~~chase each other~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the restless sea of change, feeding its ^foaming^ flocks \
~~of foam~~ to lose them over and over again, beating its hands \
against the calm of the sky. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the centre of this circling war-dance of the light \
and the dark, Love, you have your green-island, where the \
sun kisses the shy forest shade and silence is wooed by \
birds' songs.
