[This whole part is crossed out] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~I wish I had some~~ ^O that I were loved? with a^ secret ~~of my own,~~ like unshed \
rain in summer clouds, - ~~some~~ ^a^ secret ~~which~~ ~~I could~~ carry [lots of illegible pencil notes crossed out] \
folded in my silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I had someone to ~~whom~~ ^whisper?^ to to ~~talk in a muffled~~ \
~~voice~~ ~~by~~ ~~where~~ the slow water ~~under~~ ^??^ the trees doz~~ing~~ ^e^ in the sun. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening seems ~~hushed~~ ^?^ ~~at~~ the sounds of an unseen \
step, and you ~~come to~~ ^?^ ask me for the cause of my tears. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how to answer ~~you~~ ~~for my secret is~~ ^that is why I weep^ \
yet a secret unto me.~~ ^??^

O that I were stored with a secret, like unshed rain in \
summer clouds, - a secret, folded up in silence, \
that I could wander away with \
O that I had some one to whisper ^to^, where slow waters \
lap under trees that close in the sun. \
The hush this evening seems to expect ~~the~~ a footfall, \
and you ask me for the cause of my tears. \
I cannot give a reason why I weep, for that is \
~~still a secret kept from me.~~ \
a secret still withheld from me.
