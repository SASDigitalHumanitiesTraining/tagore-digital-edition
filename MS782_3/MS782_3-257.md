&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My world, when I was a child, you were a ^little girl-^ 
neighbour~~ing~~ \
~~girl~~, a ^loving timid^ stranger ~~timid in love~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you grew bold and talked to me across the fence, \
offering ~~to~~ me ~~your~~ toys and flowers and shells. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^Next^ ~~Y~~^y^ou coaxed me away from my work, you tempted me into \
the land ~~at~~ ^of^ the dusk of the weedy corner of some garden in \
midday loneliness. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^At length^ ~~?~~ you told me stories ~~of things that happened in~~ ^about bye gone times \
~~??? past~~, ^with^ which the present ever longs to meet, ~~praying~~ ~~??~~ \
^so as to be^ rescued from its prison ~~of~~ ^in the^ moment~~s~~.
