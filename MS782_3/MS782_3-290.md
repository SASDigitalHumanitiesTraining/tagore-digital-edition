&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask no rewards for the songs I sang to you. I \
shall be content if they live through the night, until, \
like a shepherd maiden, Dawn calls away the stars, frighten- \
ed of the sun. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there were moments when you sang your songs to \
me, and as my pride knows, my Poet, you ~~shall~~ ^will^ ever remember \
that I ~~had~~ listened and lost my heart.
