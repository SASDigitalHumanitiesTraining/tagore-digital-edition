~~38.~~ ^23^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Your bath is done~~ ^You have taken a bath^ in the dark sea. You are veiled \
in a new bride's robe and through death's arch you come \
back to repeat our wedding in the soul. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lute and the drum are not struck, the crowds \
are away and wreaths are not hung on the gate. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your unuttered words meet mine in ~~the~~ ^a^ ritual ~~of the~~ ^without^ \
~~un~~lighted lamps.
