31. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all days you have chosen this one to ~~come to~~ ^visit^ my \
garden. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the storm passed over my roses last night and \
the grass is strewn with torn leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what has brought you, ~~when~~ ^now that^ the hedges \
are laid low and rills run in the ~~lanes~~ ^walks^ ^;^ ~~when~~ the prodigal \
wealth of spring is scattered ~~away?~~ and the scent and ~~the~~ \
song of yesterday are wrecked. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet sta~~nd~~^y^ ~~for~~ a while; let me find some remnant ~~in~~ ^flowers^ \
~~the ruins~~, though I doubt if your skirt can be filled. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time will be short, for the clouds thicken and ^here^ \
^comes^ the rain ~~comes down~~ again^!^
