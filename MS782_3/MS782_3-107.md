in a new kingdom, and shame at knowing both purchased by wrong \
done or connived at, like warring thorns^,^ would lacerate our \
bosoms. The Pandavas are too proud ever to accept back from us \

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sire, the punishment imposed on our son will be more ours \
than his. A judge callous to the pain that he inflicts \
loses the right to judge. And if you spare your son to save \
yourself pain, then all the culprits ever punished by your \
hands will cry before God's throne for vengeance^,^ - had they \
not also their father? 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more of this, Queen, I pray you. Our son is abandoned \

his guilt and tread the path of destruction^,^

panion. What is done is done^:^ let follow what must follow^!^ (Exit) [underlined]

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be calm, my heart, and patiently await God's judgement. \
Oblivious night wears on, the morning of reckoning nears, I \
hear the thundering roar of its chariot. Woman, bow your head
