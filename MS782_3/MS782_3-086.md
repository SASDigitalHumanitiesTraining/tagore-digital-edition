~~22.~~ ^25^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that your brief days of love have not been left \
behind in those scanty years of your life. [22?/] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek to know in what place, away from the slow-thieving \
dust, you keep them now. I find in my solitude some song of \
your evening that died, yet left a deathless echo, and the \
sighs of your unsatisfied hours I find nestled in the warm \
quiet of the autumn noon. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your desires come from the hive of the past to haunt my \
heart and I sit still to listen to their wings.
