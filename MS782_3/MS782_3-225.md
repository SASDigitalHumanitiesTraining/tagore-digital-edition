~~20.~~ ^15^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night deepens and the dying flame flickers in \
the lamp. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot to notice when the evening, - like a village \
girl who ha~~s~~^d^ filled ^her pitcher^ at the river ~~her last vessel of the~~ ^a last time for that^ day - \
closed the door ~~in~~ ^on^ her ~~chamber~~ ^cabin^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was speaking to you, my love, with ~~a~~ mind barely \
conscious of ~~its~~ ^my^ voice - ~~and I ask you~~ ^tell me^, had it any meaning? \
Did it ~~give~~ ^bring^ you any message ~~which lies hidden~~ ^from^ beyond life's ^borders.^ \
~~?~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~But~~ ^For^ now, ~~when the~~ ^since my^ voice ^has^ cease~~s~~^d^, I feel the night \
throbbing with thoughts that gaze in awe at the abyss of \
their dumbness.
