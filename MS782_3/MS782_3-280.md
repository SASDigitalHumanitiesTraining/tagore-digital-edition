for justice, ~~from~~ your ministers waiting to discuss matters of \
grave import, and ~~could make you disregard even~~ ^even lead you to slight^ a Brahmin's \
blessing^?^ ~~in a blind heedlessness?"~~

Somaka. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~For a while~~ ^At first^ my heart ~~was afire~~ ^flamed^ with anger; ~~but~~ ^the next moment^ I trampled \
it down ~~the next moment~~ like the raised head of a snake and \
meekly ~~said~~ ^replied^; "Having only one child I have lost my peace of \
mind. Forgive me ~~for~~ this once, and I promise that in future \
the father's infatuation shall never ~~overcome~~ ^usurp^ the King."

Ritvik. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my heart was ~~still~~ bitter with resentment, and I said: \
"If you must be delivered from the curse of having only one \
child, I can show you the way. But so hard is it that I feel \
certain you will fail to follow it." ~~Smitton in his pride the~~ \
~~King~~ ^This galled the king's pride and he^ stood up and exclaimed: "I swear, by all that is sacred, \
~~and tell you~~ as a Kshatriya and a King, I ~~shall~~ ^will^ ~~never~~ ^not^ shrink^,^ ^but^ \
~~from~~ ^perform^ whatever you may ask ~~me to perform~~, however hard ~~it may~~ \
~~be~~." "Then listen ~~to me~~," ~~I~~ said ^I^^,^ "Light ~~up~~ a sacrificial \
fire ~~with my help~~ ^and^, offer~~ing to it~~ ^up^ your ~~own~~ son, ~~and~~ the smoke \
~~which will rise~~ ^that rises^ will bring progeny, as ~~the~~ clouds bring rain." \
The King bowed his head upon his breast and remained silent: \
the courtiers shouted their horror ~~and~~ the Brahmins ~~shut their~~ ^clapped^ \
^their hands^ ^over their^ ears ~~with their hands~~, ~~say~~^cry^ing: "Sin it is ^both^ to utter and ~~to~~ \
listen to such words." After ^some^ moments of bewilder~~ment~~^ed^ ~~and~~ \
dismay the King ~~broke his silence and~~ calmly said: ^"^~~It shall~~ \
~~be done and~~I will bide by my promise." ~~On t~~ ^T^he day ~~when~~ ^came^, the \
fire was lit^,^ the town was ~~deserted~~ ^emptied^ of its people, ~~and when~~ the \
child was called for^,^ ~~at the appointed time~~ ^but^ the attendants \
refused to ~~carry out the King's order and~~ ^obey^ the soldiers rebel- \
liously walked away, throwing down their arms. ~~But~~ ^Then^ I, who in \
my wisdom had soared far above all weakness~~es~~ of heart and to \
whom emotions were illusory, went myself ~~in~~to the apartment \
where ~~the~~ ^with their arms^ women ~~guarded~~ ^fenced^ ~~in their arms~~ the child like a flower \
surrounded by the menacing branches of ~~the~~ ^a^ tree. ~~When h~~ ^H^e saw \
me ~~he~~ ^and^ stretched out ~~his~~ eager ~~arms~~ ^hands^ and struggled to come to me, \
for he longed to be free from ~~this~~ ^the love^ ~~close~~ ^that^ i~~n~~^m^-prison~~ment~~^ed^ him ~~of love~~. \
~~Saying aloud~~ ^Crying^ "I am ~~here~~ ^come^ to give you true deliverance" - I \
snatched him by force from ~~his~~ ^his^ fainting mother and ~~his~~ ^his^ nurses \
wailing in despair. With quivering tongues the fire licked \
the sky and the King stood beside it, still and silent, like a \
tree str~~icken~~^uck^ dead by lightning. Fascinated by the godly \
splendour of the fire the child babbled in glee and danced in \
my arms^,^ impatient to seek ~~its~~ ^an^ unknown nurse in the free~~dom~~ ^glory^ of \
th~~e~~^ose^ flames. 

Somaka. \
Stop, ~~I pray~~, no more ^I pray^ ~~of this~~.
