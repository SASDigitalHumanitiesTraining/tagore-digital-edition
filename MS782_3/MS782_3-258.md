[F 102]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often, great Earth, ^have^ I ~~have~~ felt ~~in me the longing~~ ^my being yearn^ \
to ~~spread~~ ^flow^ over you ~~without limit~~, sharing in the happiness \
of each grass blade that raises its signal banner in \
answer to the beckoning blue of the sky. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel as if I had belonged to you ages before I was \
born. That is why, in the days when the autumn light shimmers \
on the mellowing ears of rice, I seem to remember a past \
when my mind was everywhere, and ^even^ to hear ~~the~~ voices ~~of my~~ ^as of^ \
playfellows ~~of remote time coming to me from behind the~~ ^echoing from the remote and deeply-veiled past^. \
~~screen~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, in the evening, the cattle return to their \
folds, raising dust ~~in~~ ^from^ the meadow paths, and ^as^ the moon \
rises ~~above~~ ^higher than^ the smoke ascending from the village huts, \
I feel ~~in me a~~ sad~~ness~~ as ~~of a~~ ^for some^ great separation, that \
happened in the first morning of existence.
