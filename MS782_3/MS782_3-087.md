[F 201]

~~23.~~ ^26^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have taken a bath in the dark sea. You are ^once ~~more~~ again^ veiled in \
a ~~new~~ bride's robe^,^ and through death's arch you come back to \
repeat our wedding in the soul. \
~~The~~ ^niether^ lute ~~and the~~ ^nor^ drum ~~are not~~ ^is^ struck, ~~the~~ ^no^ crowd~~s~~ are ^has?^ \
~~away and~~ ^gathered, not a^ wreath~~s~~ ~~are not~~ ^is^ hung on the gate. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your unuttered words meet mine in a ritual ~~without~~ ^unillumined?^ \
~~unlighted~~ ^??^ lamps.
