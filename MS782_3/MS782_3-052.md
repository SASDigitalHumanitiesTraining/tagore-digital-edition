Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things are beyond the power of words. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes, I know. My love has sounded your heart's deepes^t,^ \
and makes me bold to speak in defiance of your reserve. Never \
leave me^!^ remain here^!^ fame gives no happiness. Friend, you \
cannot now escape^,^ for your secret is mine^!^

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, Devayani. 

[Square bracket]Devayani. \
[33/A] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How "No?" Do not lie to me! Love's insight is divine. \
Day after day, in raising your head, in a glance, in the motion \
of your hands, your love spoke as the sea speaks through its \
waves. On a sudden my voice would send your heart quivering \
through your limbs - have I never witnseesed it? I know you, \
and therefore you are my captive forever. The very king of \
your Gods shall not sever this bond. 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it for this, Devayani, that I toiled, away from my \
home and kindred, all these years? 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not? Is only knowledge precious? Is love cheap? \
Lay hold on this moment. Have the courage to own that a \
woman's heart is worth all as much penance as men undergo \
for the sake of power, knowledge, or reputation.
