&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The King sat in silent anger when t~~^T^he General came before \
~~his presence~~ ^the silent and angry king^ and saluting him said : "The village is punished the \
men are stricken to dust, and the women cower in their unlit homes \
afraid to weep aloud." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Priest stood up and blessed the King and cried : \
"God's mercy is ever upon you." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clown^,^ when he heard this, burst out laughing and startled \
the court. The King's frown darkened. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The honour of the throne" ^,^ said the minister^,^ "is upheld by \
the King's prowess and the blessing of Almighty God." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder laughed the
Clown, and the King growled^,^ - "Unseemly \
m~~0~~^i^rth!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has showered many blessings upon your head^,^" said the \
Clown, "The one he bestowed[??] on me was the gift of laughter." \
"This gift will cost you your life^,^" said the King gripping \
his sword with his right hand. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the Clown stood up and laughed till he laughed no more. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow of dred fell upon the Court, for they heard that \
laughter echoing in the depth of God's silence.
