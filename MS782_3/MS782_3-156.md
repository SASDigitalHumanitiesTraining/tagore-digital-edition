&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^[^ ~~The hill stream~~ ^When^ like a flaming scimitar ~~having~~ ^the hill stream has^ been \
sheathed in gloom by the evening, suddenly a flock of birds \
passes overhead, their loud-laughing wings hurling their \
flight like an arrow among stars. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It startles a passion for speed in the heart of all \
motionless things^;^ the hills seem to feel in their bosom the \
anguish of storm-clouds, and trees long to break their rooted \
shackles. \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me the flight of these birds has rent a veil of \
stillness^,^ ~~revealing~~ ^and reveals^ an immense flutter in this deep silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see these hills and forests flying across time to \
the unknown, and darkness thrill~~ing~~ into fire as the stars \
wing by. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[this] I feel in my own being
the rush of the sea-crossing \
bird, cleaving a way beyond the limits of life and death, \
while the migrant world cries with a myr~~a~~^ia^d voices, "Not \
here, but somewhere else, in the bosom of the Far-away".
