rotten fruit and dead rats - never rouse~~s~~ ^her to^ ~~the~~ question ~~on?~~ \
~~her mind,~~ "Why should these ^things^ be?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ~~it as her ease with ? piece~~ ^accepts every stone^ of her paving ~~?~~. \
But from between their chinks sometimes ~~?? out~~ a blade \
of grass ^peeps up^. ~~It~~ ^That^ baffles her ~~to think~~. ~~h~~^H^ow ^can solid facts permit^ such intrusion^!^ ~~could~~ \
~~happen out of the solid facts.~~ 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Some~~ ^On a^ morning ^when^ at the touch of autumn ~~'s~~ ^-light^ her houses \
wake up into beauty from their foul dreams^,^ she whispers to \
herself: "There is a limitless wonder somewhere beyond these \
buildings". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ~~morning~~ hours pass on; the households are \
astir; the maid ~~walks~~ ^strolls^ back from the market swinging her ~~left~~ ^right^ \
arm and with the ~~right~~ ^left^ clasping the basket of provisions \
~~at~~ ^to^ her side, the air grows thick with the smell and the \
smoke of ~~the~~ kitchen^s^. \
~~again i~~ ^I^t ^again^ becomes clear to our Lane \
~~that all ? ^the^ as real and normal ~~is~~ in the reals of these \
rows of houses~~ \
^that the real and normal consist solely of herself and \
her houses.
