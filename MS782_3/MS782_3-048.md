^Kacha and Devayani^ [x3 underlined] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Kacha came from Paradise to learn the secret of \
immortality ~~of~~ ^from^ a Sage who taught the Titans ^,^ and whose daughter \
Devayani fell in love with him. [mark on side] 

Kacha. [x2 underlined] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come for me to take leave, Devayani; I \
have long sat at your father's feet ^,^ but to-day he completed \
his teaching. Graciously allow me to go back to the land \
of the Gods whence I came. 

Devayani ^I.^ [x2 underlined] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have, as you desired, won that rare knowledge coveted \
by the Gods^:^ - but think, do you aspire after
nothing further? 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. 

Devayani ^I.^ [x2 underlined] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing at all! Dive into the bottom of your heart; \
does no timid wish ~~hide?~~ lurk ~~,~~ there^,^  fearful lest it be blighted? 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me the sun of fulfilment has risen, and the stars \
have faded in its light. I have mastered the knowledge which \
gives life. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you must be the one happy being in creation. Alas! \
now for the first time I feel what torture these
days spent \
in an alien land have been to you^,^ though we offered you our \
best.
