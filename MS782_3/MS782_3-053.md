Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave my solemn promise to the Gods that I would bring \
them this lore of deathless life. 

Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it true you had eyes for nothing save your books? \
That you never broke off your studies to pay me homage with \
flowers, never lay in wait for a chance, ^of^ an evening, to help \
me water my flower-beds? What made you sit by me on the grass \
and sing songs you brought hither from the assembly of the \
stars, while darkness stooped over the river bank as love \
droops over its own sad silence? Were these parts
of a cruel \
conspiracy plotted over your ~~p~~^P^aradise? Was all for the sake of \
access to my father's heart ^?^ - and after success, were you, \
departing, to throw some cheap gratitude, like small coins, \
to the deluded doorkeeper? 

Kacha. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What profit were there, proud woman, in knowing the truth? \
If I did wrong to serve you with a passionate devotion cherished \
in secret, I have had ample punishment. This is no time to \
question whether my love be true of not; my life's work awaits \
me. Though my heart must henceforth enclose a red flame vainly \
striving to devour emptiness, still I must go back to that \
Paradise which will nevermore be ~~p~~^P^aradise to me. I owe the \
Gods a new divinity^,^ hard-won by my studies^,^ before I may think \
of happiness. Forgive me, Davayani, and know that my suffering \
is doubled by the pain I unwillingly inflict upon you.
