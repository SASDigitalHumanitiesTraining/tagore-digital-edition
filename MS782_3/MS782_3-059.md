1. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Sakhi [^1], my sorrows know no bounds. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August comes laden with rain clouds and my house is \
desolate. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stormy sky growls, the earth is flooded with rain, \
my love is far away, and my heart is torn with anguish. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peacocks dance ~~at~~ ^, for^ ^the clouds^ ^rumble^ ~~rumbling of clouds~~ and ^frogs croak.^ \
~~croaking of frogs croak~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night brims with
darkness flicked with lightning \
~~flashes.~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vidyapati [^2] asks, "Maiden, how are you to spend your \
days and nights without your lord?" 

2. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucky was my awakening ~~from sleep~~ this morning, for \
I saw my beloved. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was one piece of joy^,^ and my life and youth \
were fulfilled. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day my house becomes my house in truth^,^ and my \
body my body.
