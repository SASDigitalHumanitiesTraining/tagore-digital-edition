Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^This is a^ terrible ~~is this prayer from you~~ ^boon for you ~~ro crave~~, his^ ~~M~~^m^other^,^ ~~of kings~~ ^to crave^. 

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~This prayer is not only mine, it comes from t~~^T^he fathers of \
the Kauravas, who are in paradise, ^join me in beseeching you^. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divine judge will punish him who has broken his laws. \
But I am his father.

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~And a~~ ^A^m I not his mother? Have I not ~~borne~~ ^carried^ him under my \
throbbing heart? Yet I ask ~~of~~ you, ^to^ renounce Duryodhana the \
unrighteous. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~And w~~ ^W^hat will remain to us after that? 

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's blessing. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what will that bring ~~to~~ us? 

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New afflictions. [pencil] Pleasure in our son's presence, pride in a \
new kingdom^,^ and shame at knowing both purchased by wrong \
done or connived at, like warring thorns would lacerate our \
bosoms. The Pandavas are too proud ever to accept back from \
us the la~~urels~~^nds^ which they have relinquished; therefore it is only \
meet that we draw some great sorrow down on our heads so \
as to deprive that unmerited reward of its sting. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen, you ~~are~~ inflict~~ing~~ fresh pain ~~up~~on ~~the~~ ^a^ heart \
already rent.

Gandhari. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sire, the punishment imposed ~~up~~on our son will be more \
ours than his. ~~When the~~ ^A^ judge ~~is~~ callous ^to^ the pain that he \
inflicts ~~he has not~~ ^loses^ the right to judge. And if you ~~withdraw~~ ^spare^ 
5.
