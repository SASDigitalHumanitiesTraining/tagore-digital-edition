31.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~For was t~~ ^T^he day ~~when~~ ^came for^ the image from the temple ~~would~~ ^to^ \
be ~~taken~~ ^drawn^ round the holy town in its chariot. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen said to the King, "Let us go and attend the \
festival". ~~and the king was ?~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only ~~there was~~ one ~~who~~ ^man in the whole household^ did not join in the pilgrimage. \
His work was to collect the stalks of spear-grass to make ~~?~~ \
broom^s^ for the king's house. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the servants said in pity to him, "You may \
come with us". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed his head saying "It cannot be". 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man dwelt by the road along which the king's follow- \
ers had to pass. And when the Minister's elephant reached \
this spot, he called to him and said: "Come with us and see \
the God ~~coming out~~ ^ride^ in his chariot." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"~~The king's way is not mine~~ ^I dare not seek god after the king's fashion^" said the man. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"~~will~~ ^How should^ you ever have such luck ^again as^ to see the God in \
his chariot?" asked the Minister. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When ~~he~~ god ~~comes~~ himself ^comes^ to my door," answered the man. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister laughed loud and said, "Fool, ~~the~~ ^'When^ God come~~s~~^s^ \
to your door' ^and^ ~~when~~ ~~the~~ ^a^ king ^must^ travel~~s~~ to see ^him^." [?] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"~~That shows I am poor~~ ^That shows how poor I am^"  said the man. \
This: 'Fool, "When God comes \
to your door!" ~~and~~ ^yet^ a king must travel to see him!
