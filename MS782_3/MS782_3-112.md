&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~It is your breath that breathes me forth in living \
notes of joy and sorrow~~ ^I am^ ~~breathed forth in~~ ~~shaped into~~ ^poured forth in^ ^living notes of joy and sorrow by your breath^.  \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mornings and evenings in summer and in rains, I am \
fashioned ~~in~~ ^to^ music. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~But if~~ ^Should^ I ~~am~~ ^be^ wholly spent in ~~one passing strain?~~ ^some flight^ of \
song, I shall not grieve, ~~for~~ the tune ~~has been precious to~~ ^is so clear to me^ \
~~me~~.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is a flute
~~that has been played upon~~ ^he has played on^ by him. \
If ^ever^ it ~~be~~ fall~~en~~ in^to^ other hands ^let him^  fling it away. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lover's flute is dear to him, therefore if to-day \
~~the breath be~~ alien ~~and the notes that of a stranger, then~~ ^ breath have entered it and ~~shape?~~ sounded strange notes,^ \
^let him^ break ~~it~~ ^it^ ~~in~~to pieces and strew ~~them upon~~ the dust. ^with them.^ 

5.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In love the ~~end is only love,~~ ^aim is ~~naught but~~ neither pain nor pleasure ^but love only,^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Love is~~ ^While^ free ~~while it~~ ^love^ binds, ~~it is nothing apart~~, ^division destroys it^ ~~it~~ ^for love^ \
~~dwells within all that~~ ^is ~~that?~~ what^
unites. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The love fire is lighted from lovefire~~ ^Love is ?? from love as fire from fire^ but ~~where is~~ ^whence came^ \
~~the original~~ ^the first^ flame? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~It is~~ ~~i~~^I^n your being, it leaps ~~up from blows of pain~~ ^~~up at the pain of blows~~^ ^under the ?? of pain^ \
^Then,^ When the hidden fired ~~blazes~~ ^flames^ forth, the in and the out \
are ~~made~~ one and ~~the~~ ^all^ barriers ~~burned to~~ ^fall in^ ashes.
