[F 15]

13.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a child that frets and pushes away its toys my \
heart to-day shakes its head at every phrase I suggest and \
says, "No, not this". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet words, in the agony of their vagueness, haunt my \
mind, like vagrant clouds hovering over hills waiting for some \
chance wind to relieve them of their rain. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But leave these vain efforts, my soul, for the stillness \
will ripen its own music in the dark. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life to-day is like a cloister during some penance \
where the spring is afraid to stir or to whisper. [^1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the time, my love, for you to pass the gate; \
at the mere thought of your anklet bells tinkling down the \
path, the garden echoes are ashamed. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that to-morrow's songs are in bud to-day, and should \
they see you walk by they would struggle ^strain?^ to burst ^breaking?^ their \
immature hearts. 
[^1]: pencil note: a break?
