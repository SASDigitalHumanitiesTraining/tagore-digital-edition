repeated fever ~~.~~^,^ ~~L~~^l^ike a dead tree unable to draw a single \
drop of sap from anywhere. \

child into the sun^,^ where he sits by the road^-^side in the \
shortening shadows of each forenoon. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world passes by - a woman to fetch water, a herd-boy \
with cattle to pasture, a laden cart to the distant market - \
and the mother hopes that some least stir of life may touch \
the awful torpor of her dying son.
