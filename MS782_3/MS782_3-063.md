[F 176]

I \
Endlessly varied art thou in the exuberant world, Lady \
of manifold magnificence. Thy path is strewn with lights, \
thy touch thrills[?] into flowers; that trailing skirt of thine \
sweeps the whirl of a dance among the stars, and \
thy many-toned music is echoed from innumerable \
worlds through signs and colours. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single and alone in the unfathomed stillness of the \
soul, art thou, Lady of Silence and Solitude, a vision \
thrilled[?] with light, a lonely lotus blossoming on the \
stem of love.
