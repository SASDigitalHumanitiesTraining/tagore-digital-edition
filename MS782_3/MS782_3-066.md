&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While stepping  into the carriage she turned her head \
slightly and threw me a swift glance of farewell. [3/] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was her last gift to me. But where can I keep it \
safe from the trampling hours? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must evening sweep this gleam of anguish away^,^ as it will \
the last flicker of fire from the sunset? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ought it to be washed off by the rain, as ~~secret~~ ^treasured^ pollens \
are from heart-broken flowers? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave kingly glory and the wealth of the rich for death. \
But may not tears keep ever fresh the memory of a glance \
flung through a passionate moment? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me to keep," said my song, "I never touch \
kings' glory or the wealth of the rich, but these small things \
are mine for ever."
