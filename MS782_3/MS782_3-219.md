~~14.~~ ^9^ \
^The man speaks?^ ~~?~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have made me great with your love, though I am \
but one among the many, drifting in the common tide, rocking \
in the fluctua~~ting~~ ^nt^ favour of the world. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have given me a seat where poets of all time \
bring their ~~song~~ tribute~~s~~ and lovers ~~of~~ ^with^ deathless names \
greet one another across the ages. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men ^hastily^ pass me ~~by in haste~~ in the market,  never ~~knowing~~ ^noting^ \
~~that~~ ^how^ my body has grown precious with your caress, ~~that~~ ^how^ I \
carry ~~in me~~ your kiss ^within^, as the sun carries in its orb the \
fire of the divine touch that shines for ever.
