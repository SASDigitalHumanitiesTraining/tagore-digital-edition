&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask no reward~~s~~ for the songs I sang ~~to~~ you. I shall be \
content if they live through the night, until, like a shepherd^-^ \
maiden, Dawn calls away the stars, ~~frightened of~~ ^in alarm at^ the sun. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there were moments when you sang your songs to me, \
and as my pride knows, my Poet, you will ever remember that I \
listened and lost my heart.
