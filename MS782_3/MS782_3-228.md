~~8.~~ ^18^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father came back from the funeral rites. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boy of seven stood at the window with eyes wide \
open and a golden amulet hanging from his neck, ~~thinking~~ ^full of thoughts^ \
~~of what he knew not himself~~ ^too difficult for his age^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father took him in his arms and the boy asked \
him, "Where is mother?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In heaven," answered ~~the~~ ^his^ father, pointing to the sky. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night the father groaned in slumber, weary with \
grief. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lamp dimly burned near the bedroom door and a \
lizard chased moths on the wall. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy woke up from sleep, felt with his hands the \
emptiness in the bed, and stole out to the open terrace. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy raised his eyes to the sky and ^long^ gazed ~~on~~ in \
silence. His bewildered mind sent abroad into the night \
the question, "Where is heaven?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer came^:^ and the stars seemed like ^the^ burning \
tear^s^ ~~drops~~ of the ignorant dark^ness^.
