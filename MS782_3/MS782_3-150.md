&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, King, you must never go to Heaven alone, and thus \
create a second hell for me, to burn both with fire and with \
hatred of you^!^ Stay here^!^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will stay. 

Shades. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crown the despair and inglorious suffering of hell \
with the triumph of a soul ~~.~~^!^
