12. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You desired my love and yet you did not love me. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore my life clings to you like a chain of which \
clank and grip grow harsher the more you struggle to be free. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My despair has become your deadly companion clutching \
at the faintest of your favours, trying to drag you away into \
the cavern of tears. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have shattered my freedom and with its wreck built \
your own prison.
