~~12.~~ ^15^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have donned this new robe to-day because my body feels \
like singing. [12/?] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough that I am given to my love once and for \
ever, but out of that I must fashion new gifts every day; and \
shall I not seem a fresh offering^,^ dressed in a new robe? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart, like the evening sky, has its endless passion \
for colour, and therefore I change my veils^,^ which have now the green of the cool young grass and now that of the winter \
rice. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day my robe is tinted with the rain-rimmed blue of the \
sky. It brings to my limbs the colour of the
boundless, the \
colour of the oversea hills; and it carries in its folds the \
delight of summer clouds flying in the wind.
