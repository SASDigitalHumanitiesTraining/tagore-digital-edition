~~11.~~ ^8^ ^a woman speaks^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Leave~~ ^Lay down^ your lute, my love, ~~let~~ ^leave^ your arms ~~be~~ free \
~~to surrender themselves~~ ^to embrace^ me. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your touch bring my overflowing heart to my \
body's utmost brink. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not bend your neck and turn away your face, \
but offer up ~~your~~ ^a^ kiss to me, which ~~is~~ ^has been^ ~~like~~ some perfume ^long^ \
closed in ~~the~~ ^a^ bud. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not smother this moment under vain words, \
but let \
our hearts quake ~~with~~ ^in^ a rush of silence sweeping all \
thoughts to the shoreless delight.
