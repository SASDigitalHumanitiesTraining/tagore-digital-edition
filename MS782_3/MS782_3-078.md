~~14.~~ ^17^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night the song came to me; but you were not \
there. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It found the words for which I had been seeking all day. \
Yes, in the stillness ~~,~~ a moment after dark they throbbed into \
music, even as the stars then ~~commenced pulsing~~ ^began to pulse^ with light; \
but you were not there. My hope was to sing it to you in the \
morning^;^ but^,^ try as I might, though the music came, the words \
hung back, when you were beside me. [14/]
