&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am like the night to you, little flower.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only give you peace and a wakeful silence hidden \
in the dark. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the morning you open your eyes, I shall leave \
you to the world humming with ~~its~~ bees and singing with ~~its~~ \
birds. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last gift to you will be a tear ~~drop~~ dropped into the \
depth of your youth; it will make your smile all the sweeter ^for^ ^others^, \
and bemist your vision *out look on* [^1] of the pitiless mirth of day.
