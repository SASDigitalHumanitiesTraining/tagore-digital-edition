~~17.~~ ^12^ ^Woman^ ^The woman speaks^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have donned this new robe to-day because my body \
feels ~~it would sing~~ ~~^?^~~ ^like singing.^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough that I am given to my love once \
and for ever, but out of that ~~surrender~~ I must fashion \
new gifts every day; and ~~do~~ ^shall^ I not seem a fresh offering \
~~to my lover~~ dressed in a new robe? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart, like the evening sky, has its endless \
passion for colour~~s~~, and therefore I change my veils, \
which ~~?~~ have ^now^ the green of the cool young grass and \
now ^that^ of the winter rice. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day my robe is tinted with the rain-rimmed \
blue of the sky. \
[run on] It brings to my limbs the colour of the boundless, \
the colour of the oversea hills; and it carries in its folds \
the delight of ~~the~~ summer clouds flying in the wind~~s~~.
