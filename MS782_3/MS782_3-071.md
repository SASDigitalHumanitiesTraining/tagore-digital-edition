&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I shall stop startled if ever we meet after our \
next birth^,^ walking in the light of a far^-^away world. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall know those dark eyes then as morning stars, and \
yet feel that they have belonged to some unremembered evening \
sky of a former life. [7/] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall know that the magic of your face is not all its \
own, but has stolen the passionate light that was ~~once~~ in my \
eyes at some immemorial meeting^,^ and then gathered from my \
love a mystery that has now forgotten its origin.
