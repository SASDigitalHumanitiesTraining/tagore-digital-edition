6. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was to go away; still she did not speak. But I felt, from \
a slight quiver, her yearning arms would say: "Ah no, not yet ~~"~~ ^."^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often heard her pleading hands vocal in a touch^,^ though \
they knew not what they said. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known those arms to stammer when, had they not, they \
would have become youth's garland round my neck. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little gestures return to remembrance in the covert of \
still hours^,^ ~~as~~ ^like^ truants ^they^ playfully reveal~~ing to me~~ things she had kept \
secret till then.
