&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me the supreme courage of love, this is my \
prayer, - the courage to speak, to do, to suffer at thy \
will, to leave all things or to be left alone. Strengthen \
me on errands of danger, honour me with pain, and ~~lead~~ ^help^ me \
^climb^ ~~^up^~~ to that difficult ~~height~~ ^mood^ ~~where~~ ^which^ sacrifices ~~are~~ daily ~~brought~~ \
~~up~~ to thee. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[All crossed out]Give me the supreme ~~faith~~ ^confidence^ of love, this is my prayer, - \
the faith ~~of the~~ ^that belongs to^ life in death, ~~of the ~~ ^to^ victory in defeat, \
~~of~~ ^to^ the power hidden in ~~the~~ frail~~ness~~ ~~of~~ beauty, ~~of~~ ^to^ th~~e~~^at^ \
dignity ~~of~~ ^in^ pain ~~that~~ ^which^ accepts hurt, but disdains to return \
it. [end]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^Give me the supreme confidence of love, this \
is my prayer, - the confidence that belongs to \
life in death, to victory in defeat, to the power \
hidden in frailest beauty, to that dignity in \
pain which accepts hurt, but disdains to return it.^
