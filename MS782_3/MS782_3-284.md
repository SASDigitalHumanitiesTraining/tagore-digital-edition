V.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl ~~took~~ carried the pitcher ~~and went~~ home. She held it \
up in different  lights and tried to con its mystery. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night she left her bed, lighted lamp and gazed at \
it from all points of view. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time ~~in her life which she~~ ^she had^ met ^with^ \
something ~~which had~~ ^with^ no meaning. 

VI. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day, the man was again ~~seen~~ near the well. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl asked, "What ~~is your wish~~ ^do you want^?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"~~More~~ ^To do more^ work ~~from your hand~~ ^for you^," ~~the man answered~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What work^?^" she enquired. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"^Allow me to^ weave coloured ~~threads~~ ^strands^ into a ribbon, \
~~with which~~ ^to^ bind your hair." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there any need ~~?~~ ?" she asked. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None whatever," said he. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribbon was made and ~~from now it took~~ ^thenceforward she spent^ a great deal \
of time ~~for the girl to dress~~ ^over^ her hair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ~~unbroken~~ ^even^ stretch ~~of busy~~ ^of well-employed^ time in ^that^ Paradise began \
to show irregular rents. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders were troubled ~~and~~ ^;^ they met in council. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide confessed his blunder, saying that had \
brought ~~a~~ ^the^ wrong man to ~~a~~ ^the^ wrong place. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong man was called. His turban, ~~with~~ flaming ^with^ \
colour~~s~~, made ~~it~~ plain ^how great^ ~~that~~ ~~the~~ ^great^ blunder was ~~?~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the elders said ~~to him~~, "You must go \
back to the earth." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man heaved a sigh of relief and said, "I am ready." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl ~~who tied~~ ^with the ribbon round^ her hair ~~with the ribbon came and~~ ^chimed in^ \
~~said~~, "I ~~am~~ also." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^For the first time^ the chief of the elders ~~For the first time~~ ~~in his~~ ^was^ \
~~experience not~~ ^faced^ with a situation which had no ~~meaning~~ ^sense in it^.
