&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Leave her~~ ^Be not concerned about her^ ^heart^, my heart, ~~in the  secrecy~~ ^leave it in the dark^ ~~^secret ??^~~ \
~~the dark.~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if her beauty be of the figure and her smile \
merely of the face, let me take without question the simple \
meaning of her glances and be happy. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I care not if it be a web of delusion that her arms \
wind about me, for the web itself is rich and rare, and the \
~~untruth~~ ^deceit^ can be smiled at and forgotten. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Leave her heart alone~~ ^Be not concerned about her heart; be content ~~with~~ ^if^ the \
music, ~~that~~ is true, ~~of~~ ^though the^ words ~~which it they~~ ^are^ not ~~be wise~~ to ^be^ \
believe^d^, ~~and~~ enjoy the grace that dances like a lily on the \
rippling ^deceiving^ surface ~~of her deception~~ ^whatever may lie beneath.
