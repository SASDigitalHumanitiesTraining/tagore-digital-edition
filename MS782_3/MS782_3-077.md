&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I would write love's words in their own colour; \
but that lies deep in the heart^,^ and tears are pale. [13/] \
[ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you know them, friend, if the words were colourless? \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I would sing love's words to their own tune, \
but that sounds only in my heart^,^ and my eyes are silent. \
[ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you know them, friend, if there were no tune?
