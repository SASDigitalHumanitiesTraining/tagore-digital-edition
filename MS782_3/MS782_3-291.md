58.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, when the dew glistened upon the grass, \
you came ~~to me~~ and gave a push to my swing, ~~and rocking~~ ~~^swaying^~~ ^but sweeping^ \
~~between~~ ^from^ smiles ~~and~~ ^to^ tears I did not know you. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came April's noon of gorgeous light, and I think \
you beckoned me to follow you. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I ~~would see~~ ^sought^ your face, there passed between \
us the procession of flowers, and men and women flinging \
their songs to the south wind. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily I passed you ~~by~~ unheeded on the road. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ~~there was~~ ^on some^ days full of the faint smell of oleanders, \
when the wind was wilful among ~~the~~ complaining palm leaves, \
~~and~~ ~~^when^~~ I would stand before you wondering if you ever had been \
a stranger to me.
