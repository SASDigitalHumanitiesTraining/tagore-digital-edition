The Fugitive II
I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkly you sweep on ~~unseen~~, Eternal ~~Runaway~~ ^Fugitive^, ~~at~~ ^round^ whose \
bodiless rush stagnant space frets ~~it no~~ [^1] ~~forms and~~ eddying \
bubbles of light. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your heart lost to the Lover calling you across \
his immeasurable loneliness? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~And~~ ~~i~~^I^s ~~it for~~ the aching ~~urge~~ ^urgency^ of your ~~hurry~~ ^haste^ the sole ~~??~~ reason why^ your \
tangled tresses break into stormy riot and ~~fire~~ pearls ^of fire^ roll \
~~??~~ ^alone^ your path ~~torn~~ ^as^ from ~~your~~ ^a broken^ necklace? \
[^2] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your fleeting steps kiss the dust of th~~e~~^is^ world into \
sweetness, sweeping aside ~~its~~ ^all^ waste; the ~~dance~~ ^storm^ ~~shaken~~ ^centred^ \
~~from~~ ^with^ your ^dancing^ limbs ~~freshens life with~~ ^shakes^ the sacred shower of death ~~.~~ \
^over life and freshens her growth.^ 
[^3]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~If~~ ^Should you^ in ~~a~~ sudden weariness ~~you~~ stop~~ped~~ for a moment, the \
world would ~~howl~~ ^rumble^? into a heap ~~of~~ ^an?^ encumbrance, ~~growing to~~ ^barring?^ its \
own ~~self a barrier~~ ^progress^, and ~~the smallest~~ ^even the least^ speck of dust would \
pierce the sky through^out^ its infinity with an unbearable \
pressure ~~of pause~~.
[^4] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~It has quickened~~ ~~m~~^M^y ~~poor ??~~ thoughts ^are quickened by^
this rhythm \
of ~~the~~ unseen feet ~~shaking their~~ ^round which the^ anklets of light ^are shaken^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~For their steps are~~ ^Then^ echo~~ing~~^e^ in ^the pulse of^ my heart ~~-beat~~, and ^through^ \
~~in~~ my blood ~~swells~~ ^surges^ the psalm of the ancient sea.
