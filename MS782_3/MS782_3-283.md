III.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very busy girl comes to fetch water from the well. \
Her ~~steps upon~~ ^feet run on^ the pavement ~~she?~~ like ~~the run of~~ rapid fingers \
~~upon~~ ^over^ harp strings. Hastily she ties a negligent knot with \
her hair, and loose locks on her forehead pry into the dark \
of her eyes. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~One day t~~ ^T^he man came to her and said, "~~If only~~ Would you \
~~?~~ lend me your pitcher ~~!~~ ^?^" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My pitcher?" she asked, "to ~~carry~~ ^draw^ water?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, to paint ~~designs~~ ^patterns^ on ~~it~~," ~~the man answered~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no time to waste," said the girl in contempt.

IIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a busy soul has no chance against one who is \
supremely idle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day she meets him ~~by~~ ^at^ the well and every day he \
repeats the same request ~~to her~~, till ~~on day~~ ^at last^ she yielded. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man painted the pitcher ~~in~~ ^with^ curious colours ~~and~~ ^in a^ \
mysterious maze~~s~~ of lines. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took it up, turned it round and asked ~~him~~, \
"What does it mean?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has no meaning," ^he^ answered ~~the man~~.
