~~18.~~ ^13^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I would write love's words in their own \
colour, but ~~the colour~~ ^that^ lies deep in the heart and ~~the~~ \
tears are pale. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you know ~~it~~ ^them^, friend, if the words were ~~simple~~ ^colourless?^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I would sing love's words ~~in~~ ^to^ their own \
tune, but ~~the tune flows hidden~~ ^that sounds only^ in my heart and my eyes \
are ~~dumb~~ ^silent^.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you know ~~it~~ ^them^, friend, ~~if my words were silent?~~ ~~the~~ ^if there were no ~~words~~ tune?^
