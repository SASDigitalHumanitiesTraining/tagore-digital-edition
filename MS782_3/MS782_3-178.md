KUNTI \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am dogged \
By curse more deadly even than thy reproach: \
I have five sons and yet my heart is like \
Hers who has been bereaved of all her children! \
Through that great rent, which yawned when my \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first-born \
Was cut from me, my life's whole pleasures have \
Run out to waste. Accursed be that hour^!^ \
[a short pause] \
When I trod down my motherhood, thou couldst \
Not even protest one word; to-day, thy mother \
Begs but one word to salve her recreancy: \
Let thy forgiveness burn my heart - eat out \
Like hungry  flame the sin that loads and clogs it! 

KARNA \
Mother, accept my tears. 

KUNTI \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O son, dream not \
That I came forth merely to fill these arms \
With my first born; my purpose was to restore \
Thee thy full rights^!^ Come, and receive the due \
Of a king's son among thy royal brethren^!^ 

KARNA \
I am more truly son to a charioteer, \
And do not covet greater parentage. 

KUNTI \
Though that be so: come, take over a kingdom \
Thine by right^!^ 

KARNA \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou refusedst me long since \
A mother's love; wilt thou now tempt me with \
My brother's kingdom? Thy hand ~~??~~ snapt from \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the root \
That frail first stem of kinship, and, in stead, \
Sap from another source has made me strong. \
Shame were mine to call the mother of kings \
'Mother', while, in the charioteer's small house, \
Pined for her son, my mother. \
