&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ~~are~~ ^have been^ in my heart ~~from my~~ ^ever since I was a^ child~~hood~~, ^throughout^ ~~in~~ my youth, \
~~in~~ ^throughout^ my life, ~~and in~~ ^even through^ all my dreams. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You dwell in my being when I sleep and when I wake. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that I am a woman, and bear with me when you \
find me wanting. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have thought and thought and know for certain \
that all that is left for me in this world is your love, \
and if I lose you for a moment I die. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chandidas says, "Be tender to her who is yours in life \
and death."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"~~Buy fruits, buy fruits~~ ^Fruit to sell, fruit to sell^," cried the woman at the door. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Child came out of the house. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me ^some^ fruits," said he putting a handful of rice in \
~~the~~ ^her^ basket. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fruitseller gazed at his face ~~with~~ ^and her^ eyes ~~swimming~~ ^swam^ \
with tears. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the fortunate mother," she cried, "~~who~~ ^that has^ clasped \
you in her arms and fed you at her breast, ^and^ whom your dear \
voice called 'Mother?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Offer your fruit to him," says the poet, "and with it \
your life."
