&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ferry-boat plies between the two villages facing each \
other across the narrow stream. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water is neither wide nor deep - a mere break in the \
path that enhances the small adventures of daily life, like \
a break in the words of a song across which the tune gleefully \
streams. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ^the^ towers of wealth rise high ~~to~~ ^and^ crash to ~~that~~ ruin, \
these villages talk to each other across the garrulous stream, \
and the ferry-boat plies between them, age after age, from \
seed-time to harvest.
