&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name ~~by which she called me grew in life. in~~ ^she called me by, like a flourishing jasmine^ \
~~the seventeen years of our love~~ ^covered the whole seventeen years of our love^. With its sound mingled the \
quiver of the light through the leaves, the scent of the grass \
in the rainy night, and the sad silence of the last hour of \
many an idle day. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the work of God alone was he who answered to that \
name; ~~but of her knowing of him for seventeen swift years~~ ^she created him again for herself during those seventeen^ \
^swift years^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other years were to follow, but their vagrant days^,^ \
~~?~~ no longer fathered within the ~~ring?~~ ^fold^ of that name uttered \
in her voice^,^ ~~and thus they die away~~ ^stray^ and are scattered. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ask me, ~~"With whom shall we ?"~~ ^"Who should fold us?"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find no answer and sit silent, and they cry to me \
while dispersing, ~~"We go to ?"~~ ^"We seek a shepherdess!"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~?~~ Whom should they seek? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they do not know. And like derelict evening \
clouds they drift in the trackless dark and are lost and \
forgotten.
