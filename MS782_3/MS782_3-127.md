&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your holiday, my boy ~~,~~ ^;^ there are the blue sky and the \
bare field, the barn and the ruined temple under the ancient \
tamarind. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My holiday must be taken through yours ~~;~~ ^,^ finding light \
in the dance of your eyes, music in your noisy shouts. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you autumn brings the true holiday freedom: to me it \
bring the impossibility of work; for lo! you burst into my \
room. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, my holiday is an endless freedom for love to disturb \
me.
