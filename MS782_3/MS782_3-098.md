&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painter [double underline] was selling pictures at the fair; followed by \
servants^,^ there passed the son of a minister who in youth had \
cheated this painter's father so that he had died of a broken \
heart. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy lingered before the pictures and chose one for \
himself. The painter ~~turned it upside down~~ ^flung a cloth over it^ and said he would \
not sell it. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this the boy pined heart-sick till his father \
came and offered a large price. But the painter kept the \
picture unsold on his shop-wall and grimly sat
before it^,^ \
saying to himself, "This is my revenge".
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sole form this painter's worship took was to trace \
an image of his god every morning. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he felt these pictures grow ^daily^ more different ~~daily~~ \
from those he used to paint. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This troubled him^,^ and he sought in vain for an explanation \
till one day he started up from work in horror; the eyes of \
the god he had just drawn were those of the minister^,^ and so \
were the lips. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore up the picture^,^ crying "My revenge has returned \
on my head".
