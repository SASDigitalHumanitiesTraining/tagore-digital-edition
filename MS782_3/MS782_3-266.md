I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the morning he came out to walk ~~in the~~ ^a^ road \
shaded by a ~~row~~ ^file^ of deodars [underlined], ^and^ coil~~ing~~^ed^ round ~~the~~ ^a^ hill like \
importunate love. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ~~had in his hand~~ ^held^ the first letter ~~of~~ ^from^ his newly \
wedded wife in ~~? from his village's home ?~~ ^their village home^, ~~asking~~ ^begging^ him to come \
to her^,^ and come soon. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touch of an absent hand ~~clung to him~~ ^haunted him^ as he walked, \
and the air seemed to take up the cry of the letter: "Love, \
my love, my sky is brimming with tears." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked himself in wonder, "How do I deserve this?" 

II. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun suddenly appeared ~~on~~ ^over^ the rim of the blue hills \
and four girls from a foreign shore came with ~~a~~ swift stride^s^, \
talking loud and followed by ~~their~~ ^a barking^ dog. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elder ~~girls turned aside their ? at~~ ^turned from^ some- \
thing strange in his insignificance, and the younger ones \
pushed each other, laughed aloud and ran ~~away~~ ^off^ in ~~an~~ exuber- \
an~~ce~~^t^ ~~of~~ mirth. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~?~~ He stopped ~~in his ?~~ and ~~dipped~~ his head ~~down~~ ^sank^. \
Then he suddenly felt ~~the touching~~ his letter ~~and~~^,^ opened \
and read it ^again^.
