# MS 782/3

[F 18]

16.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain fell fast. The river rushed and hissed. It \
licked up and swallowed the island while I waited alone on \
the lessening bank with my shelves of corn in a heap. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shadows of the opposite shore the boat crosses \
with a woman at the helm. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cry to her, "Come to my island coiled round with \
hungry water, and take away my year's harvest."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes, and takes all that I have to the last grain; \
I ask her to take me. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she says, "No" - the boat is laden with my gift and \
no room is left for me.
