&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The house logging behind its vanished wealth, stands \
like a madman on the wayside with ? on its back.~~ \
~~^lingering on after its wealth has vanished~~ \
^The house lingering on after its wealth has vanished \
stands by the wayside like a madman with a patched rag over \
his back. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day ~~it is~~ scar~~red~~^s^ ~~by the~~ ^it with spiteful^ scratches ~~of spite^ful^~~ \
~~ful times~~, and rainy months leave their fantastic signatures \
on its bared b^r^icks. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a deserted upper room, one of a pair of doors has \
~~come off its~~ ^fallen from^ rusty hinges^;^ ~~?~~ and ^the^ ~~?~~ ^other^ \
widowed^,^ ~~?~~ bangs day and night ~~with~~ ^to^ the fitful ~~winds~~ ^gusts^. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night ^the sound of^ women ~~'s~~ wailing came from th~~e~~^at^ house. \
~~It was for~~ ^They mourned^ the death of the last ~~male member~~ ^son^ of the \
family, a boy of eighteen, who earned his living by play- \
ing ~~the part of the heroine~~ ^the part of the heroine^ in a travelling theatre. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~After a~~ ^A^ few days ^more and^ the house became silent, and all \
the doors were ~~left~~ locked. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only on the north side in the upper room that desolate \
door would neither drop off to its rest not be shut, but \
swung to and fro in the wind like a self-torturing soul. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~A day came when~~ ^After a time^ children's voices echo~~ed~~ ~~in~~ ^once more through^ that house. \
~~From the nailings of~~ ^Over^ the balcony^-rail ~~ings~~^ women's clothes ~~were~~ ^are^ hung \
in the sun, a bird ~~in~~ ^whistles from^ a covered cage ~~whistled~~, and a boy \
play~~ed~~^s^ with his kite on the terrace.
