~~I.~~ ^7^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My songs are like bees^;^ they follow through the air some \
fragrant trace - some memory - of you^,^ to hum around your \
shyness^,^ eager for its hidden store. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ^the freshness of^ dawn droops in the sun, when in the noon the air \
hangs low with heaviness and the forest is silent, my songs \
return home, their languid wings dusted with gold.
