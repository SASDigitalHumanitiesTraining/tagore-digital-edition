32. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot myself for a moment, and I came. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But raise your eyes and let me know if there still \
lingers some shadow of other days, like a pale cloud on \
the horizon ^that has been^ robbed of its rain. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment bear with me if I forget myself. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roses are still in bud; they do not yet know ^how we^ \
~~our~~ neglect ~~in~~ ^to gather^ flower ~~-gathering~~ ^s^ ~~in~~ this ~~present~~ summer. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning star has the same palpitating hush; \
the early light is enmeshed in the branches ~~overshadowing~~ ^that overbrow^ \
your window as ~~on~~ ^in^ those other days. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ~~the~~ time^s^ ~~has~~ ^are^ changed, I forget for a ~~moment~~, ^little^ \
and ~~I~~ ^have^ come.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget if you ever shamed me by looking away when \
I bared ~~open~~ my heart. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only remember the words ~~impaled in~~ ^that stranded on^ the tremor of \
your lips; I remember in your dark eyes ~~the~~ sweeping shadows \
of passion, like the wings of a home-seeking bird ~~of~~ ^in^ the \
dusk. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget that you do not remember, and I come.
