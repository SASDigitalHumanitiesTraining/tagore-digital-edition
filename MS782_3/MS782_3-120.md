&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Baby's world^,^ the trees shake their leaves at him^,^ mur- \
muring verses in an ancient tongue ^that dates from^ before the age of meaning, \
and the moon feig^n^s to be of his own age - the solitary baby \
of night. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of the old, flowers dutifully blush at the \
make-believe of faery legends, and broken dolls confess that \
they are made of clay.
