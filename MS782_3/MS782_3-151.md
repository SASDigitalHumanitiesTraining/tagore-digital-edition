&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man [underline x2] had no useful work, only vagaries of various \
kinds. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it surprised him to find himseslf in Paradise \
after  ~~spending his~~ ^a^ life ^spent^ ~~in doing trifles to~~ perfecti ~~?~~ ng ^trifles^. \
^Now^ ~~But~~ the guide had taken him by mistake to the wrong \
Paradise - one meant only for good, busy souls. 
[blank line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Paradise, our man saunters along the road only \
to obstruct the rush of business. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stands aside from the path and is warned that he \
tramples on ~~the~~ sown seed. Pushed^,^ he starts up^:^ hustled^,^ he \
moves on.
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very busy girl comes to fetch water from the well. Her \
feet run on the pavement like rapid fingers over harp strings. \
Hastily she ties a negligent knot with her hair, and loose \
locks on her forehead pry into the dark of her eyes. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man ~~came~~ ^says^ to her ~~and said~~, "Would you lend me your \
pitcher?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My pitcher?" she ask~~ed~~ ^s^, "to draw water?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, to paint patterns on". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no time to waste," ~~said the~~ ^the^ girl ^says^ in contempt. 

~~But~~^Now^ a busy soul has no chance against one who is supremely \
idle.
