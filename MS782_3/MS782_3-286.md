28.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd listens in wonder to Kashi, the young singer, \
whose voice, like a sword ^in feats of skill^, dances ~~in feats of skill~~ amidst \
hopeless tangles, cuts them to pieces, and exults. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the hearers sits old Rajah Pratap in weary \
endurance. For his own life had been nourished and encircled \
by Barajlal's songs, like a happy land ~~by a river with its~~ ^which a river laces with^ \
~~branching flow of~~ beauty. His rainy evenings and ^the^ still hours \
of autumn days spoke to his heart through Barajlal's voice \
and ^his^ festiv ~~al~~ ^e^ nights trimmed their lamps and tinkled their \
bells to ~~his~~ ^those^ songs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kashi stopped for rest Pratap smilingly winked \
at Barajlal and spoke to him in whisper, "Master, now let us \
hear music and not this new fangled ~~fashion of~~ singing, \
which mimics frisky kittens hunting paralysed mice". 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older singer with his spotlessly white turban made \
a deep bow to the assembly and took his seat. ~~He~~ ^His thin fingers^ struck \
the strings of his instrument ~~with his thin fingers~~, ~~shut~~ \
his eyes ^closed^ and in timid hesitation ^his song^ began ~~his song~~. The hall \
was large, his voice feeble ~~with age~~, and Pratap shouted \
"Bravo", with ostentation, and whispered in his ears, "Just \
a little louder, ~~my~~ friend."
