&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our life sails on the uncrossed sea whose waves chase \
each other in an eternal hide-and-seek. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the restless sea of change^,^ feeding its foaming \
flocks to lose them over and over again, beating its hands \
against the calm of the sky. \
^Love, ~~I~~^i^ the centre of this circling war-dance of ~~the~~ light \
and ~~the~~ dark, ~~love~~, ~~you have your~~ ^yours is that^ green-island^,^ where the sun \
kisses the shy forest shade and silence is wooed by birds' [25/] \
~~songs~~ ^singing.^
