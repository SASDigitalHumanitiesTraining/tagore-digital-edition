[F 120]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king and his courtiers started at the sight of \
Kabir when he entered the hall. For he was not alone, ~~but~~ \
the woman followed him. Some smiled, ~~and~~ some frowned, \
and the king's face darkened ~~with anger~~ at the beggar's \
pride ~~of his own~~ ^and^ shamelessness. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabir came back to his house disgraced, ~~and~~ the woman \
fell at his feet ~~and said~~ ^crying^, "Why accept such dishonour for \
my sake, master: suffer me to go back to my ~~own?~~ infamy." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabit said, "I dare not turn ~~away~~ my God ^away^ ~~when~~ ^though^ he \
come~~s~~ branded with insult".
