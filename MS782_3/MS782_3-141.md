&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night remorse kept the girl awake. She began to \
dread her power and hate her triumph^,^ though her mind tossed \
on the waves of turbulent delight. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning she came and saluted the ascetic and \
asked his blessing, saying she must leave him. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gazed on her face in silence, then said, "Go, and may \
your wish be fulfilled". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years he sat alone till his penance was complete. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Immortals came down to tell him that \
he had won Paradise. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I no longer need it" said he. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god asked him what
greater reward he desired. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want the girl who gathers twigs."
