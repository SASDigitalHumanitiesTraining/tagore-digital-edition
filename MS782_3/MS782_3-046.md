18.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the water there is no landing; the \
girls do not come here to fetch water; the land along its \
edge is shaggy with stunted shrubs; a noisy [two lines] flock of saliks [^1] \
dig their nests in the steep bank under whose frown the \
fisher-boats find no shelter. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sit there on the unfrequented grass, and the morning \
wears on. Tell me what you do on this bank so dry that it is \
agape with cracks? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks in my face and says, "Nothing, nothing what-soever." \
[line] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the
river the bank is deserted, and no \
cattle come to water. Only some stray goats from the village \
browse the scanty grass all day, and the solitary water-hawk \
watches from an uprooted peepal [^2] aslant over the mud. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sit there alone in the miserly shade of a shimool [^3], \
and the morning wears on. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, for whom do you wait? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks in my face and says, "No one, no one at all!"
