&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full moon shone, the Prince, dressed in a wedding robe, \
entered his bride's room. \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All asked, "Where is the fairy bride?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince answered, "She has vanished for ever to make \
herself known to you."
