# MS 782/3

[F 131]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd ~~began to chat~~ ^was restless^, some yawned ~~and~~ some dozed, \
some complained of the heat. The air of the hall hummed \
with many-toned inattention, and the song, like a frail \
boat, tossed upon it in vain till it sank under the ~~?~~ \
hubbub ~~of sound~~. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the old man, stricken at heart, forgot a \
passage, and his voice groped ~~for it~~ in agony like a blind \
man ~~in~~ ^at^ a fair for his lost leader. He tried to fill the gap \
with ^any^ strain~~s~~ ~~of casual choice~~ ^that came^. But the break remained gap- \
ing: and the tortured notes ~~that~~ refused ^to serve the need^ ~~to fit~~ ^,^ suddenly \
changed their tune and broke into a sob. The master laid \
his hand on his instrument, and in place of his forgotten \
music ^there^ came ~~to~~ ^from^ him the first cry of life that a child brings \
into the world. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratap touched him gently on his shoulder, and said, \
"Come away, our meeting is elsewhere. I know, my friend, \
that truth is widowed without love, and beauty dwells not \
with the many, nor in the moment".
