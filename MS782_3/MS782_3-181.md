2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came ^hither^ together, friend, and now at the ~~bend of the~~ ^cross roads^ \
~~road~~ I stop to bid you farewell. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your path is wide and straight before you, but my \
call comes ~~from the wayside, from the wilderness of~~ ^up byeways from^ the \
unknown. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ^shall^ follow ~~the impulse of the~~ wind and ~~the~~ cloud~~s~~; \
I ^shall^ follow the stars to ~~the~~ ^where^ daybreak^s^ behind the hills; I ^shall^ \
follow ~~the~~ lovers who, as they walk, ~~make a wreath of their \
days with the one thread of song, "I love".~~ 
^twine their days into ^a^ wreath on a single thread of song, \
"I love."^
