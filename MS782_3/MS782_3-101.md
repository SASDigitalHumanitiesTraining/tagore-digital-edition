~~THE MOTHER'S PRAYER~~

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ital] Prince Duryodhana, the son of the blind Kaurava King ~~,~~ Dhri- \
tarashtra^,^ and ^,^ Queen Gandhari, has played with his cousins ~~,~~ \
the Pandava Kings ~~,~~ for their kingdom^,^ and won it by fraud. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have compassed your end. 

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success is mine! 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you happy?

Duryodhana. \
I am victorious. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask you again, what happiness have you in winning the \
undivided kingdom? 

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sire, a Kshatriya thirsts not after happiness but victory, \
that fiery wine pressed from seething jealousy. Wretchedly \
happy we were^,^ like those inglorious stains that lie idly on \
the breast of the moon, when we lived in peace under the friend- \
ly dominance of our cousins. Then these Pandavas milked the \
world of its wealth^,^ and allowed us a share^,^ in brotherly \
tolerance. Now ~~,~~ that they own defeat and expect banishment, I \
am no longer happy but exultant.
