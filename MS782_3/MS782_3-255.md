&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening ~~when~~ ^after^ they have brought their cattle \
home, they sit on the grass before their huts to know that \
you are among them unseen, to repeat in their songs the \
name which they have fondly given to you. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While kings' crowns shine and ~~burst~~ ^disappear^ like falling stars, \
^^a^round village huts^ your name rises ~~in~~ ^through^ the still night ~~round village huts~~ from \
the simple hearts of your lovers ~~of the unknown names~~ ^whose names are unrecorded^.
