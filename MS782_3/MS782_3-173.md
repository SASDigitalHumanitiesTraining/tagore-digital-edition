[Lots of pencil notes in the margin] 
Kunti the ? queen had secretly had an illegitimate child \
before her marriage, whom she had exposed, but to whose fate she \
had not been indifferent, but followed his progress as the adopted \
son of ? the charioteer. Meanwhile she had become \
mother to the fine Pandara? princess ~~and now~~ ^against whom^ her illegitimate \
now Karma is leading the ?? host. When the ~~??~~ scene opens? 

THE FOUNDLING HERO [dotted, underlined] 

KARNA ~~a young warrior~~ is found seated by the Ganges in contemp- \
lation, a woman approaches and seats herself a few paces from \
him. A pause. Then he addresses her. 

KARNA [on the side?] \
~~I am~~ Adhiratha the charioteer's son, I \
Am Karna, and ~~??sit~~ on Ganges' bank ~~to~~ ^here?^ worship \
This setting sun. Tell me who thou art. 

THE WOMAN \
That woman am who first made [I--> ??] those braves eyes \
Acquainted with the light they worship now. 

KARNA \
~~What can those words mean? as the first~~ dawn ray \
~~Flushes cold snow on some bleak summit crest \
Their tone if not their moaning touched with \
flame \
This conscious cheek, and thine eyes sadden me.~~ \
Things that not even thought-winged memory \
Can travel to, so far they lie behind, \
Might yield such power as over-glooms my soul. \
What mystery, O strange woman, links my birth \
And earliest hours to thee? 

THE WOMAN \
[lines?] \
Have patience^,^ son; \
Let thickening darkness first fold lid-like over \
The scutiny of day's eye. And meanwhile know \
That I am Kunti. 

KARNA \
[lines...] \
Kunti^:/!^ Arjuna's mother?
