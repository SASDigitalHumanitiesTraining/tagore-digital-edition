43.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked on this picture in many a month of \
March when the mustard is in bloom - this lazy line of \
the water and the grey of the sand ~~across~~ ^beyond^, the rough \
path along ~~the river-~~ bank carrying the comradeship of \
the field ~~in~~ ^into the heart of^ the village ~~heart~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to capture in rhyme the idle whistle \
of the wind, the ~~sounds~~ ^beat^ of the oar-strokes ~~of~~ ^from^ a passing \
boat. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have wondered in my mind how simply it stands \
before me, this great world, with what fond and familiar \
ease it fills my heart, this ~~meeting of~~ ^encounter with^ the Eternal \
Stranger.
