[F 289]

Our fratricidal struggle for wealth and fame \
Suddenly looks unreal as ~~hectic~~ ^frantic^ nightmare \
Shows in the moist serenity of dawn. \
Say whither thou wilt lead? 

KUNTI \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To yonder bank, \
Whence, across the ghastly waste of sand, \
Those lamps are twinkling. 

KARNA \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay, shall I find there \
My lost true mother? 

KUNTI \
(About to embrace him) \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, my son! 

KARNA \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet! [-->] \
I have a mother gentle, meek and dear, \
Who gave me her best life day after day. \
Thou thirste ~~ed?~~^st^ for my love; must she not hunger \
If now I quench thy thirst? What though this glory \
Thou offerest me, be mine, it cannot be \
So mine as is the place I fill^!^ Thou thirstest ^-^ \
Why, then, was I flung out like weed torn up \
From its first soil, across king's garden wall? \
Why was this murderous gulf set twi^x^t myself \
And thine Arjuna, converting to the dire \
Attraction of hate that of kind near kinship? 

(A pause) 

Thy silence aches. I feel thy shame work through \
The darkness till that tingles and my flesh \
Dreads its ^^ contact. 

(Pause). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clench thy dumbness here \
As the wise hand will crunch the stinging weed \
Which softly handled does far worse offence: \
Never reply ~~.~~ ^!^ Leave thou my question helpless \
As is a child exposed in homeless night^!^ \
Never explain what made these rob thy son \
Of his own mother's love^!^ Only tell why \
Thou beckonest me back unto that heaven \
Those very hands have ruined. \
