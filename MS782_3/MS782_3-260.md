48.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king-fisher sits still on the prow of an empty \
boat, while ~~at~~ ^in^ the shallow margin of the stream a buffalo \
lies ~~in~~ tranquil^ly^ bliss^ful^, its eyes half closed ~~with~~ ^to savour^ the \
luxury of cool mud. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undismayed by the barking of the village cur, the \
cow browses on the bank followed by a hopping group of \
saliks [underlined] hunting moths. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit in the tamarind grove, where ~~most~~ the cries \
of dumb life ^congregate^ - the cattle's lowing, the sparrows' chatter, \
the shrill scream of a kite overhead, the crickets' chirp \
and the splash ~~in the water by the sudden stir of a fish~~ ^of a fish in the water^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I peep into the primeval nursey of life, where the \
mother Earth thrills ~~with~~ ^at^ the first living clutch ~~at~~ ^near^ her \
breast.
