&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiercely they rent in~~to~~ pieces the carpet woven ~~by~~ ^during^ ages \
of prayer for the welcome of the world's best hope. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great preparations of love lie~~s~~ ~~in~~ a ~~waste~~ heap ^of shreds^ and \
there is nothing ~~in~~ ^on^ the ruined altar to remind the mad crowd \
~~of threading? of their God~~ ^that their god was to have come^. In a fury of passion they seem \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lute said ~~to me~~ "~~Fling me to~~ ^Trample me in^ the dust". \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the dust by the roadside. There was a \
tiny flower among thorns. And I cried, "~~The hope of the~~ \
world^'s hope^ is not dead." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^The sky stooped over the horizon to whisper \
to the earth and a hush^
