NOTE: [underlined] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prose translation Rabindranath Tagore's 'Karna and \
Kunti' [$] is inevitably shorn of the movement and glow of verse. \
Treating it as I might a sketch of my own, I have endeavoured to \
restore both in my own way, and hope, in so doing, not to have \
diminished the essential poetry of conception which marks it, even \
in English prose, as a masterpiece. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T. Sturge Moore.
