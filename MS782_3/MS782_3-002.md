# MS 782/3

[F 2 folio 1]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My songs are like bees, they follow through the air some \
fragrant trace - some memory - of you to hum around your \
shyness eager for its hidden store. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ^the^ dawn ^-flower^ droops in the sun, when in the noon the air \
hangs low with heaviness and the forest is silent, my songs \
return home, their languid wings dusted with gold.
