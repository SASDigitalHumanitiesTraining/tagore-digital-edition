&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not concerned about her heart, my heart; leave it \
in the dark. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if her beauty be of the figure and her smile merely \
of the face, let me take without question the simple meaning \
of her glances and be happy. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I care not if it be a web of delusion that her arms wind \
about me, for the web itself is rich and rare, and the deceit \
can be smiled at and forgotten. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not concerned about her heart, my heart: be content if \
the music is true though the words are not to be believed; \
enjoy the grace that dances like a lily on the rippling, \
deceiving surface whatever may lie beneath.
