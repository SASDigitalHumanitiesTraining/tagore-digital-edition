~~12.~~ ^5^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You give yourself to me, like a flower that blossoms \
at night, ~~which~~ ^whose presence^ is known by the ^dew that^ drip~~ping~~^s^ ~~of its dew~~ ^from it^, by the \
odour ~~which is guessed~~ ^shed through the darkness^, as the ^first^ steps of Spring are by the \
buds ^that thicken the twigs^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You break upon my thought, like waves at the high \
tide, and my heart is drowned under surging songs ~~of love~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~You come to my heart, like the approach of awaking \
at the verge of the watching gloom. The clouds are aflmae, \
and my sky fills with ~~the~~ ^a great revealing^ of a great revealment.~~ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^My heart knew of your coming as the night \
feels the approach of dawn. The clouds are aflame \
and my sky fills with a great revealing flood.^
