45. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes feel the deep peace of this sky, and ~~I seem~~ ^there^ \
~~to know in all my limbs~~ ^stirs through me^ what a tree feels when it holds \
out ^its^ leaves ~~to fill its cups~~ ^like cups to be filled^ with sunshine. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought rises in my mind, like the warm breath \
from grass in the sun; it mingles with the gurgle of \
~~the~~ lapping water and the sigh of ~~the~~ weary wind in ~~the~~ \
village lane^s^^,^ - the thought that I have lived along with \
~~til~~ the ^whole^ life of this world and have given to it my own \
love and sorrows.
