&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night deepenss and the dying flame flickers in the \
lamp. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot to notice when the evening - like a village \
girl who has filled her pitcher at the river a last time for \
that day - closed the door on her cabin. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was speaking to you, my love, with mind barely conscious \
of my voice - tell me, had it any meaning? Did it bring \
you any message from beyond life's borders? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, since my voice has ceased, I feel the night \
throbbing with thoughts that gaze in awe at the abyss of \
their dumbness.
