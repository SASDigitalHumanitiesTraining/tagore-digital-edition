~~the~~ ^At^ midnight ^the moon^ is never jealous of the ^noonday^ sun ~~of the noon~~. But the \
struggle to share ~~the~~^one^ horizon ~~by~~ between both ~~the~~ orbs can not last \
forever. Thank heaven, that struggle is over and we have \
~~attained~~ at last ^won^ ~~the~~ solitude ~~of~~ ^in^ glory.

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean jealousy! 

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealousy is never mean - it is in the ~~nature~~ ^essence^ of ~~the great~~ greatness. \
~~only g~~ ^G^rass can grow in crowded amity, not ~~the~~ giant trees. \
Stars live in clusters, but the sun and moon are lonely in their \
splendour. The pale moon of the Pandavas sets behind the \
forest \
shadows leaving the new-risen sun of the Kauravas to rejoice. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ~~what is~~ right has been defeated. 

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~What is r~~ ^R^ight for the rulers ~~of men~~ is not what is right \
~~for~~ ^in the eyes of^ the people. The people thrive ~~in~~ ^by^ comradeship, but for a \
king ~~those men~~ ^equals^ are enemies ~~who are his equals~~. They are \
obstacles ~~when in front~~ ^ahead^, they are ~~a~~ terror^s^ ~~when~~ ^from^ behind. There \
is no place for brothers or friends in a king's polity; its \
one solid foundation is conquest. 

Dhritarashtra. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refuse to call ~~it~~ ^a^ conquest ~~deceitfully to win in~~ ^what was won by fraud in^ gambling.

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~It is no shame for a~~ ^A^ man ^is^ ^not shamed by refusing^ to challenge a tiger ~~to~~ \
~~fight~~ on equal terms with teeth and nails. Our weapons are ~~^?^~~ ^those^ \
^proper^ ~~those which lead us to~~ ^achieve^ ^for^ success ~~and~~ not ~~to~~ ^for^ suicide. Father, \
I am proud of the ~~end we have achieved~~ ^result^ and disdain ~~feebly to~~ \
regret ^for^ the ^^ means. 

Dhritarshtra. \
But justice - 

Duryodhana. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Only f~~ ^F^ools ^alone^ dream of justice ^;^ ~~before~~ success is ^not yet theirs:^ ~~attained~~,
