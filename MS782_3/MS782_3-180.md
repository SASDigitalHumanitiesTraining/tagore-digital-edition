1. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My songs are like bees, they follow ~~in~~ ^through^ the air \
some fragrant trace ~~of your remembrance, and they~~ ^some memory of you to^ hum \
around your shyness ~~seeking~~ ^eager for^ its hidden store. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dawn droops in the sun, when in the noon the \
air hangs low with heaviness ~~of the forest's silence~~ ^and the forest is silent^, my \
songs return home, their ^languid^ wings ~~languid~~ ~~with golden dust~~ ^dusted with gold^.
