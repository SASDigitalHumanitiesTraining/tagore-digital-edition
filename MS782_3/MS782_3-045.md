# MS 782/3 

[F 158] 

^17^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening beckons^,^ and I would fain follow the travellers \
who sailed in the last ferry of the ebb-tide to cross the dark. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were for home, some for the farther shore, yet all \
have ventured to sail. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I sit alone at the landing, having left my home and [19] \
missed the boat ^:^ summer is gone and my winter harvest is lost. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait for that love which gathers failures to sow them \
in tears on the dark^,^ that they may bear fruit when day rises \
anew.
