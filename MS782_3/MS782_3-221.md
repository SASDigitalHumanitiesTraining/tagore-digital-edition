~~16.~~ ^11^ ^The woman speaks^
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I had I have to you~~r~~ keeping but the \
barest veil of reserve. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so thin that you secretly smile at it and \
I feel ashamed. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gust of the spring breeze sweeps it away un- \
awares, and the flutter of my own heart moves it as the \
waves move their foam. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love, do not grieve if I keep ~~it~~ ^this flimsy mist of distance^ to myself ~~, -~~ \
~~only this flimsy mist of distance.~~ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This frail reserve of mine is not mere woman's \
coyness, but a slender stem of which ~~my flower blossoms \
towards you with its reticent grace of surrender~~. 
^the flower of my self surrender bends towards you \
with reticent grace.
