Devayani. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgiveness! You have angered my heart till it is hard \
and burning like a thunder-bolt! You can go back to your \
work and your glo^r^y, but what is left for me? Memory is a \
bed of thorns^,^ and secret shame will gnaw at the roots of my \
life. You came like a wayfarer, sat through the sunny hours \
in the shade of my garden, and to while time away you plucked \
all its flowers nd wove them into a chain. And now, parting, \
you snap the thread and let the flowers drop on the dust! \
Accursed be that great knowledge you have earned^! -^ a burden ~~.~~ \
that^,^ though others share equally with you, will never be ~~I?~~ \
lightened. ~~f~~^F^or lack of love may it ever remain as foreign \
to your life as the cold stars are to the unespoused darkness \
of virgin Night!
