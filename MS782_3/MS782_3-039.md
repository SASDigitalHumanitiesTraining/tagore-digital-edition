~~25.~~ ^11^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You^,^ ~~are~~ like a rivulet ~~,~~ swift and sinuous ~~,~~ ~~you~~ ^,^ laugh \
and dance, ^and^ your steps sing~~s~~ as you trip ~~away~~ ^long^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I^,^ ~~am~~ like a bank ~~,~~ rugged and steep ~~; I~~ ^,^ stand ^speechless and stock-^ still \
and darkly gaze at you ~~speechless~~.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ^,^ ~~am~~ like a big^,^ ~~and~~ foolish storm ~~I~~ ^, of a sudden^ come rushing ^on^ \
~~of a sudden~~ ^and,^ try~~ing~~ to rend my being ~~into pieces~~ and scatter ^it^ \
~~the pieces~~ ~~then~~ ^parcelled^ in a whirl of passion. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You^,^ ~~are~~ like ~~a~~ ^the^ lightning^'s^ flash ~~,~~ slender and keen, \
pierc~~ing~~^e^ the heart of the turbulent darkness to disappear \
in a ~~quick???~~ ^vivid streak^ of laughter.
