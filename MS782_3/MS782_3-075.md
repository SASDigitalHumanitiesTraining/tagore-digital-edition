~~10.~~ ^13^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence do you bring this disquiet, my love? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let my heart touch yours and kiss the pain out of your \
silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night has thrown up from its depth this little hour, \
that love may build a new world ~~.~~ within these shut doors, and \
lighted by this solitary lamp. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have for music but a single reed which our two pairs \
of lips must play on by turns - for crown^,^ only one garland to \
bind my hair after I have put it on your forehead. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearing the veil from my breast I shall make our bed on \
the floor; and one kiss and one sleep of delight shall fill \
our small boundless world. [/11]
