The Charioteer. \

[161/?]be forced to listen ^[^ to this recital of a deed which makes hell \
shudder in pity.

Somaka. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive off in your chariot! ~~-~~ Brahmin, my place is by you \
in this hell. The gods may forget my sin, but can I forget \
the last look of agonised surprise on my child's face when, \
for one terrible moment, he realised that his own father had \
betrayed his trust?

Dharma. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your sin has been swept away in the fury of pain it caused \
you.
