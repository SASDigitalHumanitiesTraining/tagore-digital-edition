# MS 782/3

[F 140]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the thundering flood ~~of~~ ^tumbling^ my life from ~~tumbling~~ \
world to world and form to form, scattering my being in ^an^ \
endless spray of gifts, in sorrowings and songs. [^1] 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide runs high, the wind blows, the boat dances \
like thin^e^ own desire, my heart! \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave ~~behind~~ the hoard~~ing~~ ~~of~~ ^on^ the shore and sail ~~on~~ \
~~the voyage~~ over the unfathomed dark towards ~~this~~ ^limitless^ light ^.^ ~~without~~ \
~~limit.~~
