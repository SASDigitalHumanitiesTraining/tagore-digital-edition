15.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all days you have chosen this one to visit my garden. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the storm passed over my roses last night and the \
grass is strewn with torn leaves. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what has brought you, now that the hedges \
are laid low and rills run in the walks; the prodigal \
wealth of spring is scattered and the scent and song of yester- \
day are wrecked. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet stay ~~for~~ a while; let me find some remnant flowers \
though I doubt if your skirt can be filled. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time will be short, for the clouds thicken and here \
comes the rain again!
