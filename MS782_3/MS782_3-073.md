[pencile note: L.Laing?] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have made me great with your love, though I am but \
one among the many, drifting in the common tide, rocking \
in the fluctuant favour of the world. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have given me a seat where poets of all time bring \
their tribute^,^ and lovers with deathless names greet one another \
across the ages. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men hastily pass me ~~by~~ in the market, ^-^ never noting how \
my body has grown precious with your caress, how I carry your \
kiss within^,^ as the sunn carries in its orb the fire of the \
divine touch ~~that~~ ^and^ shine ~~?~~^s^ for ever.
