&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The day was done, and it grew dark~~ ^It was growing dark^ when I asked her, \
"What strange land ~~is this where I have come?"~~ ^have I come to?"^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ~~said no words, but~~ ^only^ lowered her eyes, ~~and with a~~ ^and the water gurgled^ \
~~gurgle in her water jar~~ ^in the throat of her jar, as^ she walked away. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~In the gloom,~~ ~~t~~^The trees ^hang ??^ ~~grow~~ vague^ly^ over ~~on~~ the bank, and \
the land appears as ~~through some storied past~~ ^though it already belonged to the past^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water is dumb, the bamboos ^are^ darkly still, ~~while~~ \
a wristlet tinkles against the water jar ~~along~~ ^from down^ the lane. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row no more, but fasten the boat ~~at~~ ^to^ this tree, - for \
I love the look of this land. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening star goes down behind the temple dome, \
and the pallor of the marble-landing haunts the dark water. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The window lights, weirdly wrought in the wayside \
shadows, draw^s^ sighs from the late passers by ~~^late way farers^~~ , while ~~^still^~~ the ~~^that^~~~~ \
wristlet tinkles against the water jar, and retreating steps \
rustle ~~alone~~ ^from down^ the lane ~~strewn with~~ littered ^with^ ~~^??^~~ leaves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night deepens, the palace towers loom spectre-like \
and ~~the hum of the town is weary and low~~ [illegible writing] ^the town hums wearily^. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row no more, but fasten the boat at ~~that~~ ^to a^ t~~h~~^r^ee. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me seek rest in this strange land, ^dimly^ lying ~~dim~~ under \
~~the~~ ^the^ stars, where darkness ~~trembles~~ ^tingles^ with the tinkle of a wrist- \
let knocking against ~~the~~ ^a^ water jar.
