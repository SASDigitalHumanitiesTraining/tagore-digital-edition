63. [omit]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the noontide work, like a flood, rushes along \
its branching channels, and the pulse of the city throbs \
and aches with the heat of its crowded ~~striving~~ ^strife^, I shut \
my eyes and suddenly feel the calm of thy solitude spread \
over all houses and hearts, over all thoughts and noisy \
endeavours.
