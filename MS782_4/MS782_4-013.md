55. [omit?]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long I sat unaware of the twilight standing behind \
my day's troubled thoughts. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came a stir in the air, and lifting my head I \
suddenly saw across the road the full moon large like a \
child's eye widened in wonder. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It startled me and I felt that an unexpected letter \
of love ~~is~~ ^had^ dropped before my window from beyond all time. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is breaking itself in its wish to write \
~~back~~ and answer, groping for a message great as the night of \
unseen flowers and stars unknown.
