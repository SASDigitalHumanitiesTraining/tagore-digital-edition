40. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain clouds of summer darken the air, and the \
sky bends ~~down to~~ ^over^ the earth whispering to her, "I am thine." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth says, "Thou art boundless, but I am small." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have ^the clouds^ drawn round me ~~clouds~~," says the sky, "~~my~~ ^a tent^ \
~~boundaries of~~ ^to enclose myself and say^ love." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth says, "My heart filled with tears flutters \
in the wind, but thou art moveless." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My tears answer to thine," the sky says, "they \
tremble in ~~their depth of the dark~~ ^the dark into ? the clouds^" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the space that ever separates him from the earth \
he fills with the cry of the wind and the rain, - the \
wedding hym of a pair who meets yet remain apart.
