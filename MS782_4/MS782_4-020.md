[Misc 20]

65. [omit]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing across the dark night I came on my pilgrimage \
to this earth, I know not whence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent my noisy day with the crowd on the road, in \
the inn; I fought for my place in the market till the day- \
light waned. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly I remem~~v~~^b^er with a pang that I have not entered \
the temple. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave, call me to your presence where you \
are alone. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the evening the outer gate is shut in your \
temple, call me from distractions of light to your darkness, \
where to see you I must hold up my own little lamp with its \
timid flame.
