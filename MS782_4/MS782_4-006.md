7. [omit]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King's son came to the sleeping land^.^ ~~and~~ ^He^ crowned \
with his wreath the king's daughter while she slept. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April's kiss startled the woodland at the purple \
slope of the hill and the spell of sleep was broken in the \
land. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers woke with a shock of joy, the ~~bride~~ ^birds^ \
revelled in wonder at their own unwearied songs, and the \
south wind burst into the room of the king's daughter in a \
boisterous struggle to speak. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer steals away behind the resonant shadow of \
rains; the autumn spends its last gold in the sad ceremonial \
of sunsets, giving way to the winter of long nights and \
blurred stars. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king's daughter sits alone at her window and \
wonders who it was that came with his wreath ~~when~~ ^while^ she slept.
