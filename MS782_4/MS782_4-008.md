&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love is but the ~~seeking of my~~ ^search for my^ truth in you. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ~~is to~~ find^s^ - ~~with the added mystery of your \
presence~~, - ~~my~~ ^the same^ flowers and clouds, ~~the~~ ^the same^ patient earth with \
its busy days, the ^same sky^ inscrutabl~~e~~^y^ silen~~ce~~^t^ ~~of the sky~~ ^with the added mystery of your presence^ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, beloved, that there is a world, at the \
meeting of hearts, where immortal moments shine; ~~where~~ ^whither^ \
my songs fly to measure the immeasurable with ~~every~~ ^their wings^ \
~~wing-beat~~. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let ~~me~~ ^us^ live there, ~~to~~ ^and^ gather life's precious joys \
which blossom everywhere behind the leaves of commonplace \
hours.
