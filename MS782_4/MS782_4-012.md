54. [omit]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you mute, my heart, in this world echoing \
with voices? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have your eyes seen no vision of soul through the \
lifted curtain of the dust? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea heaves at your door singing the psalm of \
tears imprisoned in the heart of the world, and the rivers \
run by like the melting silence of the hills. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has not the light, the wing of the morning song, \
touched your forehead?
