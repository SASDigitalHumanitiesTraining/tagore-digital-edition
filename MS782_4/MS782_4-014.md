&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to me of him, my friend, and say that he has \
whispered to you in the hushed centre of storm and in the \
depth of peace where life puts on its armour in silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrink not to call his name in the crowd, for we need \
to turn our eyes to the heart of things, to see the vision \
of truth and love building the world anew out of its wreckage. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to me, my friend, of him, and make it simple \
for me to feel that he is.
