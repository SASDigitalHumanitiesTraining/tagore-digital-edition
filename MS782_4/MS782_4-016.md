60. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first met you it was in the solitude of a \
pathless dark. My wish was to hold my one lamp up to you, \
even though ~~you had~~ ^there was^ no need. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen in the market the men throwing dirt at \
your robe while you strewed the path of insult with songs. \
My wish was to crown you with a wreath, even though you \
~~had~~ ^there was^ no need . \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds were noisy in your praise, they knocked \
at your gate with their prayers, they cursed and cried. \
My wish was to give myself up to you for nothing, even \
though ~~you had~~ ^there was^ no need.
