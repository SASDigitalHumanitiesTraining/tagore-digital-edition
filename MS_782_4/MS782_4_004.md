I. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sped on to the Queen's court knowing no rest by \
day or by night. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~I was~~ ^The rush^ swept ^me^ away ~~by the rush~~ ^in^, while youth's flame \
sprang up in my heart like a sword and ^in joy^ ~~I~~ cried ~~in joy~~, "Queen, \
I shall empty your casket, and win the wreath of victory."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pilgrim among us whose young face had the \
peace of a lamp in a temple ^high^ on ~~the~~ ^some^ mountain peak. His eyes \
were like stars about to sink ~~in~~ ^through^ the depth of dawn, and the \
sky seemed to ask him what ~~was~~ ~~the~~ name ^was^ treasured ~~in~~ ^by^ his \
silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ~~questioned~~ ^asked^ if his ~~aim~~ ^hope^ was to win the wreath, \
he said, "I do not wish for the wreath of victory."

II. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen sat on her throne. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music broke forth from my lyre. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May came in April's wake and ^like a deer panting with thirst^ fled over the withered \
grass, ~~like a deer panting with thirst~~, The season of the \
rain sailed away with its tattered clouds spread in the sky. \
The autumn ~~followed~~ ^died^, and the last flower of shiuli [underlined] was shed \
on its funeral.
