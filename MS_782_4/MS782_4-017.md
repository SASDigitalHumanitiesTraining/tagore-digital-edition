61. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me lay myself down ~~at~~ ^on^ the last step of thy throne \
and live obscure, ~~tinged~~ grey with the dust ~~of~~ ^at^ thy feet. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep me not away in honoured isolation, but even \
through ignominy bring me down to the dust ~~of~~ ^at^ thy feet. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remain as the last of thy pilgrims and count \
me as the least of them. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men come to thee, asking for gifts at thy hands; let \
me wait till nothing remains but thyself and live obscure, \
~~tinged~~ grey with the dust ~~of~~ ^under^ thy feet.
