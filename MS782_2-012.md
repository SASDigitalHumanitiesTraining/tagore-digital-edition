Supposing just for fun I become a champa flower growing on a branch high up on that tree and I shake in the wind with laughter and dance upon the newly budding leaves, would you know me, mother, ~~as your child~~?

You would call, "Baby, where are you?" and I ^sh^ ~~w~~ould laugh to myself and keep quite quiet.

I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.

When after your bath you spread your wet hair on your shoulders, and ~~by~~ ^through^ the shadow of the champa tree you walk^ed^ to the little court where you say your prayers, you would notice teh scent of the flower ~~you would~~ not know ^that^ it came from me.

When after your midday meal you sit at the window reading Ramayana, and the shadow of that tree falls ~~on~~ ^over^ your hair and ~~on~~ your lap, I ~~will~~ ^should^ fling my wee little shadow onto the page of your book, just where you were reading.

But you would guess that it was the tiny shadow of your little child?

When in the evening you go to the cowshed with the lighted lamp in your hand, I ~~w~~ ^s^hould suddenly drop onto the earth again and become your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.

You would ~~ask~~ ^say^, "Where have you been, you naughty child?"

"I won't tell you, mother," I would say.

That's what you and I should say then
