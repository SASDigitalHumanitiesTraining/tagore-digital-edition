Say of him what you please but I know \
my child's feelings. \
    ~~Not~~ because he is good ~~that~~ I ^do^ ^not^ love him \
but because he is the little child. \
    How can you know how dear he ~~could~~ ^can^ be \
When you try to weigh his merits ~~and~~ ^against^ his \
faults? \
    When I must punish him he comes all the \
closer to my being. \
    When I ~~make~~ ^cause^ his tears to come my heart \
weeps with him. \
    It is I alone who am called to blame and \
punish, for he only may chastise who loves. \
I do not love him because he is good but because he is my \ little child ~~or a little child~~ ?[^1] 
he wraps himself all the closer round my being or heart [^1] 
comes all the closer [^1] 
into my being [^1]
