MS782/2 [THE END] CM.30

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for me to go, mother, I am \
going. When in the paling darkness of the \
lo~~v~~^n^ely dawn you stretch your arms for your \
baby in the bed i ~~will~~ ^shall^ say "Baby is not \
there," mother, I am going. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall become a delicate draught of air \
and caress you ~~all~~; and I shall be ripples \
in the water when you bathe and kiss you \
and kiss you again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gusty night when the rain patters \
on the leaves you will hear my whisper in \
your bed, and my laughter will flash with \
the lightening through the open window into \
your room.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you keep awake thinking of your baby \
till late into the night, I ~~will~~ ^shall^ sing to you \
from the stars, "Sleep, mother, sleep." \
On the straying moonbeams I ~~will~~ ^shall^ sing to you \
from the stars, "Sleep, mother, sleep." \
On the straying moonbeams I ~~will~~ ^shall^ steal ~~upon~~ ^over^ \
your bed, and lie upon your bosom while you \
sleep. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall become a dream and through the \
little opening of your closed eyelids, I \
~~will~~ ^shall^ slip into the depths of your slumber \
and when you wake up looking round startled, \
like a twinkling firefly I shall flit out \
into the darkness. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the great festival of puja, the \
neighbours children come and play about the \
house I shall melt into the music of the \
flute and throb in your heart all day. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Puja presents dear auntie will come \
and will ask "Where is our baby, ~~my~~ sister?" \
~~you ~~shall~~ ^will^ tell her softly, mother~~ ^then^ ^mother^ ^you^ ^will^ ^tell^ ^her^ ^softly^, "He is in \
the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and ^in^ \
my soul."
