MS.782/2 The Little Big Man. CM.25 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am small because I am a little child. \
I shall be big when I am old as my father is. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teacher will come and say, "It is late, \
bring your slate and your books." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall tell him, "Do you not know I am ^as^ big \
as ~~my~~ father ~~is~~? And I must not ~~take my~~ have les-
sons ^anymore^." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My master will wonder and say, "He can \
leave his books if he likes, for he is ~~old~~ ^grown^ ^up^." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall dress myself and walk to the fair \
where the crowd is thick. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My uncle will come rushing to me and say \
"You will get lost, my boy, Come to my arms." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall answer, "Do you not see, uncle, I \
am ^as^ big as ~~my~~ father ~~is~~. I must go to the fair
\
alone." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle will say, "Yes, he can go wherever \
he likes, for he is ~~old~~ ^grown^ ^up^." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother will come from her bath when I am \
giving money to the nurse, for I shall know \
how to open the box with my key. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother will say, in her mind, "He can give \
money to whom he likes \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother will say, "What are you ~~at~~ ^about^, naughty \
child?" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ~~will~~ ^shall^ tell her, "Mother, don't you know, \
I am ^as^ big as ~~my~~ father ~~is~~ and I must give ~~these~~ \
silver ~~pieces~~ to my nurse." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother will say in her mind, "He can give \
money to whom he likes, for he is ~~old~~ ^grown^ ^up^." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the holiday time in October father will \
come back home, and thinking that I am still \
&nbsp;&nbsp;a baby will bring for me from the town little 
shoes and small silken frocks. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall say, "Father, give them to my ^dada^ [^1] \
~~brother~~, for I am ^as^ big as you are." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father will think and say, "He can buy his \
own clothes if he likes, for he is ~~old~~ ^grown^ ^up^."
