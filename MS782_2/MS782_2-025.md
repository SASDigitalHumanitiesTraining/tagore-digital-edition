&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother, your baby is silly!     She is so \
absurdly childish! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not know the difference between \
the lights in the streets and the stars. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we play at eating with pebbles she \
thinks that they are real food and tries to \
put them in her mouth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I open a book before her and ask her \
to learn her a, b, c, she tears the leaves with \
her hands and roars in joy for nothing, this is ^your^ ^baby's^ \
~~the~~ way ~~your baby has~~ of doing her lesson. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I shake my head at her in anger and chide \
her and call her naughty she laughs and thinks it \
~~a~~ great fun. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I hold my class with the donkeys that our \
washerman brings to carry clothes and I warn her \
that I am the schoolmaster she ~~would~~ ^will^ scream for no \
reason and call me dada.[^1]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your baby wants to catch the moon and Ganesh \
she funnily calls Ganush![^2]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother, your baby is silly, she is so absurdly \
childish!

[^2]: Tagore's note: Ganesh a common name in India also of the god with the elephant's head.
