[CM 39]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The~~ ^a^ child sat ~~and~~ ^playing^ with shells. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised ~~raised~~ his head and seemed to \
know me, and said, "I ~~will buy~~ ^hire^ you ^for^ ^ever^ with \
nothing."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The day my burden was lightened and the \
bargain was made in a child's play.~~ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play \
made me a free man.* [^1]
