[CM 38]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come and ~~buy~~ ^hire^ me," I cried ^,^ ^while^ ^in^ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Some hesitated and came, some laughed \
at me, and some wiped tears in secret.~~ 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~In~~ the ~~noonday?~~ ^morning^ I was walking in the \
stone-paved road. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sword in hand the King came in his chariot. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held my hand and said, "I will ~~buy~~ ^hire^ you \
with my ~~??~~ power." 

^But^ ~~His~~ ^his^ power became ~~exhausted~~ ^as^ ^nought^ and he went ^away^ \
~~??~~ in his chariot. *Underlined 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Houses~~ ^In^ ^the^ ^heat^ ^of^ ^the^ ^midday^ ^the^ ^houses^ stood with the doors shut. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~The~~ ^an^ old man came out with his bag of gold. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pondered and said, "I will ~~buy~~ ^hire^ you \
with my ~~gold~~ ^money^." 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He counted his coins one by one ~~and~~ ^buy^ I ~~came~~ ^turned^ \
away. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was evening. The garden hedge was all \
aflower.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair maiden came out and said, "I will \
~~buy~~ ^hire^ you with a smile."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her smile paled and melted into tears \
and she went back ^alone^ into the dark. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun glistened on the sand and the sea \
waves were willful.
