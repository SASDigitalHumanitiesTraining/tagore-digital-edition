&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They clamour and fight, they doubt and des- \
pair, they know no~~t the~~ end ~~of~~ ^to^ their wranglings. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your life come ~~amidst~~ ^amongst^ them like a flame \
of light, my child, unflickering and pure, and \
delight them into silence. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are cruel in their greed and their envy, \
their words are like hidden knives thirsting \
for blood. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~You come~~ ^Go^ and stand amidst their scowling \
hearts, my child, and let your gentle eyes fall \
upon them like the forgiving peace of the eve- \
ning over the strife of the day. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them see your face, my child, and thus \
know the meaning of all things, let them love \
you and thus love each other. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come and take your seat in the bosom of the \
limitless, my child. Open and raise your heart \
in the sunrise like a blossoming flower, and \
silently bend your head in the sunset complet- \
ing the worship of the day.
