[CM.31]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was dark when she went away and \
they slept. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is dark now and I call ^for^ her ~~and~~ \
~~say~~, "Come back, my darling; the world is \
asleep; and none would know, if you ~~come~~ ^came^ for \
a moment when stars are gazing at stars."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went away when the trees were in bud \
and the spring was young. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the flowers are wild and I call ~~her~~ \
~~and say~~, "Come back, my darling. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children gather and scatter flowers \
in reckless sport. And if you come and take \
one little blossom none will miss it."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those that used to play are playing still, ^so^ \
spendthrift is ~~the~~ life. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listen to their chatter and call ~~her and~~ \
~~say~~, "Come back my darling, for mother's heart \
is full to the brim with love and if you come \
to snatch only one little kiss from her none \
will grudge it."
