Bless this little heart, this white soul that \
has ~~brought~~ ~~drawn~~ [^1] ^won^ the kiss of heaven ~~on~~ ~~into~~ ^for^ th~~e~~^is^ \
earth. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves the light of the sun, he loves ~~n?~~ \
the sight ~~of the~~ ~~face~~ of his mother's ^face^. [^2]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not learned to despise the dust, and \
to lust after gold. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasp him to your heart and bless him. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has come into this land of ^an^ hundred cross \
roads. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not how he chose you from the crowd, \
came to your door and grasped your hand to ask \
his way. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will follow you laughing and talking and ^not^ ^a^ \
~~??~~ doubt in his heart. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep his trust, lead him straight and bless \
him. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay your ~~kind~~ hand on his head and pray that \
if the waves underneath ~~become~~ ^grow^ threatening ~~and~~ \
~~turbulent let~~ ^that^ the breath from above ^may^ come and \
fill his sails and ~~lead~~ ^waft^ him to the haven of \
peace. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget him not in your hurry, ~~for ??~~. \
let him come to your heart and bless him.
