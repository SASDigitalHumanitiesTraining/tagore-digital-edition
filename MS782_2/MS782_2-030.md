MS.782/2 [THE HERO] CM.29

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them fly and a great number are \
cut to pieces. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you are thinking ^,^ sitting all by \
yourself ^,^ that your boy must be dead by this \
time. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I come to you all stained with blood \
and say, "Mother, the fight is over now." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You come out and kiss me pressing me to \
your heart, and you say to yourself, \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what I should do had I not \
my boy to escort me." \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand useless things happen day \
after day, and why couldn't such a thing come \
true by chance? \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be like a story in a book. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother would say, - "How is it possible! \
I always thought he was so delicate!" \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our village people would all
say ~~surprised~~ ^in^ ^amazement^, \
"Was it not ~~quite~~ lucky that the boy was with \
his mother?"
