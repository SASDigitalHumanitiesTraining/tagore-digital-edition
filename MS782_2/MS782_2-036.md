&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~To~~ ^I^ ^want^ ^to^ give you something ~~is my wish~~, my child, \
for we are drifting in the current of the world. \
(XP)Our lives ~~are~~ ^will^ ^be^ carried apart, and our loves ~~are~~ \
forgotten. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not so foolish as to hope that I 
could buy your heart with my gifts. P Young is (x) \
your life, your path long and (moved from here) \
you drink *our proffered love* in a hurried draught and quickly run \
(x) from us. P We indeed, have leisure enough in old \
age to count the days that are past, to cherish \
in our hearts what our hands have lost for ever. \
P The river runs swift with a song, pushing all \
the barriers before her. But the mountain stays \
and remembers, and ~~pours out his love in her \
wake~~ ^follows^ ^her^ ^with^ ^his^ ^love^.
