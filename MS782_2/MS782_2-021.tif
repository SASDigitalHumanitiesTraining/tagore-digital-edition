&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stormclouds rumble in the sky and June \
showers come down; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moist east wind comes marching over the  \
heath to blow its bagpipes among the bamboos. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden \
no one knows from where and dance upon the \
grass in wild glee. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother, I ~~truly~~^really^ think ~~these~~^the^ flowers have \
~~their~~ school under ground. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do their lessons with doors shut and \
if they want to come out to play before it is \
time for them their master makes them stand in \
a corner.

When the rains come they have their holidays. \
Branches clash together in the forest, and the \
leaves rustle in the wild winds, the thunder \
clouds clap their giant hands and the flower \
children rush out pell mell with dresses of \
pink and yellow and white.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know, mother, their home is in the \
sky, where the stars are.  \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven't you seen how eager they are to ~~go~~ ^get^ ^there^? \
Don't you know why they are in such a hurry?  \
~~Surely~~ ^Of^ ^course^ I can guess to whom they raise their \
arms, ~~??~~ they have their mother as I have \
my own.
