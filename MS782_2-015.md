&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine just on such a cloudy day the
young son of the king is riding alone on a grey horse
through the desert, in the search of the 
princess who lies imprisoned in the perilous 
palace of ~~the~~ ^a^ giant across ~~the~~ ^that^ unknown water. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the haze of the rain comes down in the 
distant sky and lightning starts up like a sudden 
fit of pain does he remember his unhappy mother,
deserted by the king, sweeping the cow stall and 
wiping her eyes, when he crosses ~~alone~~ the heath 
of Tepantar ~~of~~ ^in^ the fairy tale? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, mother, it is dusk before the day is 
over and ~~in~~ ^on^ yonder village road there ~~is~~ ^are^ no
traveller^s^ now. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd boy has gone home early from 
the pasture and men have left their fields to 
sit on ~~the~~ mat~~s~~ under the eaves of their huts 
watching the threatening clouds. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother, I have left all my books on the 
shelf -- do not ask me to do my lessons now. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I grow up and when I am big as my 
father is I shall learn all that ~~I~~ must ~~have to~~ ^be^ ^learnt.^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just for today, tell me, mother, where 
~~lies~~ the heath of Tepantar ~~of~~ ^in^ the fairy tale ^is^?
